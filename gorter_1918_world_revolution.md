## Foreword

Herman Gorter, the writer of this pamphlet, is a well known Dutch poet
and social-revolutionary. He has long been a prominent figure in
Socialist circles on the Continent, and quite recently has been made
Professor of Moscow University. He well deserves the distinction that
the Soviet Government has bestowed upon him. When so many Socialists
lost themselves in opportunism and patriotism, he was one of the few
whose vision was not blurred, and whose devotion to the cause of
Socialism was never in doubt. He was one of the very few whose judgment
was always founded on knowledge and inspired by love. The light that he
has held up so constantly and devotedly is now reflected in the spirit
of the advance guard of the Dutch proletariat. And the light that Gorter
has held up is the same light that was held up by the Dutch poetess,
Henriette Roland-Holst, and by that brilliant writer on Socialism,
Professor Pannekoek.

May these "neutrals" create among the workers of the world that
atmosphere of confidence, the absence of which was one of the causes of
the division of the world-proletariat into hostile camps -- a division
that made war possible -- a war whose burden was, is, and unless they
are united in revolution, will continue to be, thrown across the
shoulders of the proletarians of all countries.

With regard to the pamphlet itself, it is a continuation of the pamphlet
"Imperialism, World War, and Social Democracy." The latter pamphlet,
which has not yet appeared in English, proved the necessity of the unity
of the world-proletariat in its struggle against world-Imperialism. This
pamphlet shows that this struggle of the world-proletariat will be the
proletarian revolution for Socialism. The first chapter, with the
exception of a few sentences, was written in September, 1917. The last
chapter was written in July, 1918.

The official Trade Union leaders in the Anglo-Saxon lands are becoming
bolder in their Judas utterances, and more base than Judas with the
gold.

They are bold because they know that the worker has not realised that he
has been betrayed. And with the gold they have doubtless been helping to
buy up the Joy Loans of a Capitalist State.

Their protests against Intervention in Russia have been putrid with
hypocrisies.

Citizen armies -- the new Capitalist Militarism -- are to be formed in
all countries. In the British Empire, too, and yet who among these
Labour leaders has taken action?

The Capitalists are about to recruit the middle classes, yet who of
these Labour men has uttered a word of warning to these classes?

No, these Labour officials would delight to see Communism in England
become a cult for suburbia, whilst they erected the most contemptible
bureaucracy possible to imagine.

The war has taught Socialists many lessons.

After four and a half years the patriots who were clamorous for "no
compromise" triumped [sic] completely, with the result that the Ramsay
Macdonalds could not tell where they were or how they stood.

So it will be with these compromisers, these confusionists. That abyss
into which they tell us we are leading the world is their own inevitable
death-trap. For it will be a good thing if this present civilisation
crumbles away. The world-proletariat have it in them to create a better;
but not to know what to do with an old and artificial civilisation, and
not to have the moral and spiritual power to create a new one -- is
surely to be on the edge of an abyss.

In spite of these confusionists, real revolutionary Socialists have
reason to be hopeful.

There is hope, because there is a body of workers in England, in
Scotland, in Ireland, in America, in South Africa, in Australia -- a
body of workers whose thoughts are as clear as mid-day, and who will
never allow their minds to be confused again. This body is growing in
strength and numbers.

It has already entered the workshop as an "unofficial" movement.

These workers alone could assist Russia at the present moment. But they
are a minority -- a small minority.

And every move they make is followed by persecution and imprisonment.
One day, however, they will be assisted by a great force -- the idea
that saw the light of day in Russia will be once more triumphantly on
the march.

Every British workman will then have to be at his post, and he will have
to know and feel his awful responsibility. Until then -- it might be
said, the Russian Revolution has awakened in the British workman an
interest not so much in Russia as in himself as a workman. This new
knowledge is being accumulated and propagated. Intelligent action will
follow on amain.

C. Malcolm.

## Chapter 1: The Need for a World Revolution

The world revolution approaches as a result of this first world-war.

Just as a terrific storm passing through an immense forest bends the
trees on every side, so has the world-war bent the proletariat in all
directions.

For years a misdirected propaganda had been carried on, aiming only at
reform, and therefore not recognising the danger of Imperialism and of
the approaching world-war. The world proletariat, deceived by their
Governments, and betrayed by their leaders, were handed over to
Imperialism and to the war.

But they will overcome all their differences and will once more in
complete unity renew the struggle.

The war could only continue, and can only be carried on now, simply
because the workers of the world are not United.

And the Russian Revolution, betrayed by the proletariat of Europe and
America, and in the first instance by the German working class, shows
clearly that every revolution of the proletariat must ultimately fail if
the international proletariat do not present a united front to world
Imperialism.

The revolution draws near as a result of this first world war. The
proletariat of Europe and America will rise against Imperialism, and
after a long and bitter fight will bring it to an end. But Imperialism
cannot be overthrown unless Capitalism is also overthrown.

The coming fight, the coming revolution, is also the social revolution,
the revolution for Socialism. And the revolution of the European and
American proletariat will finally establish Socialism throughout the
whole world.

It is therefore not only a European and American revolution, but a world
revolution that approaches.

It is the duty of all true revolutionaries to investigate the conditions
of this revolution for Socialism, to prepare for it in advance, and to
set up an international programme of our demands.

This will be done in the following pages.

The proletariat as a whole stands opposed to Imperialism. It stands
against all the Imperialisms in the world.

There are no better or worse Imperialisms. The Imperialisms of the two
great groups, Germany on the one hand, England and America on the other,
are equally bad, and equally hateful, to the workers of the world.

This is the first thing that ought to be shown, for only when the
workers realise that there is no choice between the two, that they are
seriously threatened from both sides, and that there is no means of
escape from the two frightful Imperialisms; only when the proletariat
realise that, will they understand that a world revolution against world
Imperialism is necessary for the workers of the world.

We will show in the first place the need of a world revolution by
showing the need of Imperialism to suppress and slaughter the
proletariat, even after this war; and the similarity of these
suppressions and murders by each and all Imperialisms.

Secondly, there is no way out of this suppression and slaughter, except
by a world revolution. Thirdly, the practicability of a world-revolution
and its programme. Fourthly, that the Russian Revolution is an example
of the world revolution for the proletariat. In the 5th Chapter we shall
review the whole.

The greatest opponents, the leaders, in the fight for world power --
England and Germany -- the only belligerents who had the might, which
means the right, to carry on this struggle now stand face to face **On
One Front**, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, with all their
forces. The fight for world dominion has begun.

Russia, who had a bureaucratic and militaristic, but no strong
Capitalist Imperialism, and who was therefore not ripe for this war, has
dropped out. Only a few of the little States on both sides remain.

The United States of America have now entered the war, and it has now
become in earnest a fight for the domination of the world.

If Germany wins she will rule Europe and a great part of Asia and
Africa, and she will have made the first step towards world dominion.
Should England and the United States win, then they will rule the world.

The United States realised this and therefore they entered the war. Like
Rome and Carthage, Germany and England (with the United States) stand
opposed. Rome and Carthage fought on the Mediterranean and its coasts:
now the fight extends over every sea and ocean, and the lands between.
And like the struggle of old, there is no hope of reconciliation; it
must be a fight to a finish, till one side or the other is victorious.

This fight is for the domination of the world, and so long as people
have this object in view they will use every means and make any
sacrifice, even to the extent of sacrificing half the nation's young
blood, in order to obtain it.

In the pamphlet, "Imperialism, the World War, and Social Democracy," I
wrote that German Imperialism is as dangerous to the international
proletariat as the English. I should now say, "as the English-American."

The question arises: Is that exactly true? Or is it simply a contention?
Perhaps it is prompted by the wish to class all Imperialisms alike in
order to make it more easy to secure the necessary unity of all the
international proletariats.

Now let us examine this for a moment. Because if the Imperialism of one
power be more dangerous to the international proletariat than the
Imperialism of another, then the proletariat ought to desire the defeat
of the first and oppose it with all its strength. Then could the welfare
of the proletariat be ensured by the victory of one. Then would the
revolution perhaps be almost impossible or unnecessary.

In order to ascertain clearly whether the victory of one Imperialism
would bring greater disadvantage to the working class than other, we
must picture to ourselves what would be the result of a complete victory
of the one, and then of the other^[In order to know how a thing operates
we must examine it scientifically. We must do this here with both
Imperialisms, and therefore must regard both as in possession of full
power.].

If Germany is victorious that means that she can impose her own
conditions. She will hold Belgium in her power; she will seize a still
larger part of the coal-mining district of France; she will retain
possession of Lithuania, Esthonia, Livonia, Courland, and Poland, and
perhaps Finland. She will make Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Rumania,
and perhaps Greece, into dependencies of Austria. She will give Turkey
territory up to the Persian Gulf. She will split Russia up into parts,
making them German dependencies. She will rule the Balkans and Turkey;
she will force France and Italy into an alliance with her; she will take
back her Colonies, and some of the Colonies of the others.

Germany is then master from the coast of Flanders and Emden to the
Persian Gulf; and through Siberia into northern and central Asia.

**Germany has reached the goal for which she planned and carried on the
war**.

Germany, through her military, political and economic supremacy, and
through the trade restrictions she can impose, thus acquires complete
control over Scandinavia and Holland. Germany, then, rules Europe and a
great part of Asia, up to the very gates of British India.

But although England and the United States have been defeated on the
Continent of Europe, they are not destroyed. Their sea power is still
unbroken.

Germany, in order to have world power, must have sea power, and in order
to get that, must forthwith prepare for another war. Arbitration,
disarmament, reduction of armaments, are impossible; neither Germany nor
England, nor the United States, want it. That would kill world power and
stop the exploitation and domination of the earth. That is not what they
desire; they want to maintain Imperialism, and that can be done only by
force.

Arbitration, disarmament: these watch-words are merely lies which they,
supported by confederates such as, the Reformers and the
pseudo-Marxists, betray the workers with and keep them quiet, and enable
them to prosecute this and the following war.

What, then, are the results of a German victory?

As soon as she has recovered in a measure from the effects of this war,
Germany will immediately prepare with all her power for the next. To the
numerous weapons invented during this war she will add others still more
terrible. By her political and military supremacy she will force the
same course on all her Allies: Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Poland, the
Balkans, Scandinavia, Holland, Italy, France, and Russia. The German
organisation of the gigantic trusts, banks, factories, railroads, and
shipping, will be imposed on Europe from Holland to Constantinople.

The Prussian-German spirit, that bastard born of despotism and slavery,
presses itself through and over all Europe and rules everywhere. And the
people of Europe must obey unless they wish to be politically and
economically extinguished. This is the German "League of Nations," the
German "world-peace" that Germany wants and which through victory she
will obtain.

The working class will then be oppressed and scattered by the weight of
militarism, trusts, and enterprising companies, in every country in
Europe. And at last the second World war will break out, and it will be
still more terrible than the first: the world war for the control of
Asia and Africa. And the members of the working class will be sent out
once more to destroy each other.

These are the results of a victory for German Imperialism.

Now to the British-American. If Britain and America win and are in a
position to dictate terms, Germany will have Alsace-Lorraine, Prussian
Poland, and all her Colonies, taken from her, and perhaps also German
territory up to the Rhine. Austria will be divided into many States.
Poland will receive a part of Prussia and Galicia. The Balkans will come
under British direction. The territory of Turkey will be divided up.

**That the United States have made a condition that Austria, the Balkans
and Turkey, must withdraw themselves from German influence; and that
Arabia, Mesopotamia and Syria shall be "independent," only goes to show
how much the United States have made the policy of Britain their own
policy.** For if these conditions are fulfilled, then the British world
Empire, from the Cape through Cairo to India, will be established. To be
sure for this Britain has promised her help to the United States in the
East Asiatic and Pacific regions. Besides, Germany would be saddled with
an enormous war debt, under the name of "indemnities" and "reparations,"
which, in yearly payments, would continue for a great number of years.
Her Fleet would be reduced to a number of small craft. Heligoland would
become a British fortress. Through the loss of coal mines in Lorraine
she would be considerably weakened. She would then stand absolutely
powerless against England and America.

Russia will be in a like position if the Revolution is not able to
withstand the pressure of the victorious Imperialism of the Entente.
Weakened by internal troubles and counter-revolutions there is no saying
what may happen. The United States would obtain great influence there.

France and Italy would receive a large slice of the booty. France
especially would soon rapidly develop by means of her re-captured coal
and iron mines. But these States are not powerful enough to "play the
game" with England and America. There are only these two and Japan.

It can easily be seen what Japan is after. She makes large claims in
China, Manchuria, Siberia, lower India, etc., and therefore her power
must be broken. The colossal British Fleet (almost doubled during the
war), with the new Fleet of the United States, dominates all.

We state here in advance that these two Allies will remain together.
Their Capitalistic interests have been welded together closely during
the war, and it will certainly be to their advantage to remain together.

What is, then, the fate of the world? The United States and Britain will
do everything to prevent any other State becoming as powerful as
themselves. For this purpose they will divide Europe into a number of
small States; **and in order to dominate and exploit them they will try
to keep them weak**. They will capture the markets of the world while
Germany and Russia are still weak.

Europe, France, Italy, and the small States will simply be their
servants. It will be the same in Central and South America. It will be
as if two Emperors rode in one carriage followed by a crowd of vassals.

In all political differences in Europe and America they will play off
one State against another; just as England in the past (we are silent
here concerning her many conquests and deeds of violence) prevented
Russia, Turkey, the Balkans, Asia Minor, Egypt, Persia, India, and
therefore the whole of the Near and Far East, attaining independence and
power, by either putting one against the other, or by directly
plundering them herself; so will England and the United States deal with
Germany, Austria, Poland, Russia, Turkey and the Balkans. Similarly in
America with Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, etc.

The United States and England will turn Central and Eastern Europe into
a perfect hell. The provinces cut off from Germany, Poland the new
States formed from Austria-Hungary, the new Russian States, the Balkan
peoples and the Turks, will be continually at war with one another, and
during this time England and the United States will rule the world. They
will endeavour to make Germany economically dependent on
English-American capital. Russia will be flooded with it. They will
establish everywhere branches of their trusts and banks; and where they
do not succeed in doing so, will seek to destroy those in existence.

They will reduce Germany to such a condition of weakness as to compel
her to act in conjunction with them in the interest of their profits.
For they are masters of the sea and of the overseas markets.

Asia and Africa will be completely at their mercy, to rob and exploit as
they choose; especially China, which is partly governed by themselves
and partly by despots paid by them. Now, Germany in her fight against a
superior Power, should at least be forced to develop and make powerful
Austria, Turkey, the Balkans, Asia-Minor, and other States. England and
America do not require to do so because they have a monopoly, and also
because they are not threatened.

In Central Europe the principal Power has fallen -- the only Power that
could venture to go to war with England and America. She is politically,
and in a great measure economically, broken, and the other States are
too small and too weak to fight, and are helpless and torn by their own
internal troubles. All are alike with the exception of England. Europe
is powerless. The political wars of nations, a prime factor in the
progress of Capitalism, are now eliminated. In Central and South America
the same conditions prevail.

And the possibility of developing themselves or of obtaining
independence in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Egypt, Persia, India,
China, etc., has disappeared for a long time to come.

A weak, broken Europe, a weak South America, Asia and Africa, a weak,
broken world -- that is the aim of American politics.

But the United States, England and Japan, do not trust one another, and
apart from them there are France and Italy, still great powers, and
Russia and Germany still gathering strength and becoming themselves
again.

There are always powerful coalitions to be feared, and people begin
immediately to prepare for the new world war.

And this is the "League of Nations" and the "world peace" of the United
States and England, for which President Wilson, Asquith and Lloyd George
made so much propaganda; and in which Germany, as soon as she became
democratised will also have a place! And for this purpose they want the
self-determination of the peoples of Europe (but not of those of Asia
nor of Africa) -- the self-determination that those peoples make who are
not strong but weak; and which merely serves to prevent strong
Coalitions under Germany's leadership, and enables them to rule Europe
themselves[^note-2].

It is true, then, that the German spirit of naked brutality will not
rule. German Imperialism has become powerless.

But into its place has stepped the powerful Anglo-American monopoly, by
which a great part of the world has been brought to a standstill, and
nearly the whole of it into subjection.

And the spirit of this Imperialistic monopoly is the rough brutality and
corruption of American Capitalism, united with the refined brigandage of
the English, which makes their victims powerless.

What a combination. Refined hypocracy and false democracy!

And what will be the effect of this Imperialism on the proletariats of
the world? The American-English banks, the American-English trusts, will
rule the world. It will be very difficult for other countries to compete
with them. They will often be forced to submit.

The struggle of the proletariats will also be made difficult, almost
impossible, against this monopoly.

And this American-English Capitalism will do as the English have always
done -- buy one part of the proletariat and pit it against the other.
That part will be a well paid, well-organised, well developed
proletariat. They will use these well-fed, well-clothed, well-housed,
well-educated proletarians as bloodhounds and executioners of the
remainder of the proletariat and of the weak nations. On these people
they can always reckon in their fight against the poorer proletariat,
whom they wall always be able to stir up against the weaker nations.

A paid army such as this constitutes the greater danger to the
international proletariat. It will raise an army of traitors in all
countries. It will be able to do this, for it will have the monopoly
since Germany's fall. And it will be able to oppress the "unskilled,"
the under-fed, the poorly-paid, the badly-housed, the miserably poor
workers, as much as it likes; and the greatest number will belong to
this category. Besides, the workers will be pressed into the army.

This, then, is the "world peace" of American-English Imperialism. And
this is the world peace that a part of the bourgeoisie of the neutral
countries so earnestly desired!

But under this Imperialism war will break out again. For Germany will
gather strength again, Russia will again rise, and China will not suffer
her self to remain in slavery. The world will not remain patient. It
cannot suffer the absolute rule of American-English capital.

Capital itself is not international enough for that. Besides, the
predatory countries are still too numerous and the noise of friction too
audible. New coalitions will form themselves against England and
America. These two Powers may disagree, and the proletariats of the
world will be thrown again into the blood bath and slaughtered
whole-sale.

These, then, are the results of German and of Anglo-American
Imperialism.

On the one side Germany all-powerful on the Continent of Europe with
German militarism everywhere, and in a short time a still more frightful
world war.

On the other side England and the United States all-powerful over the
whole earth, with subjection or weakness and stagnation everywhere. And
after a little time another bath of blood.

If this first world war does not come to a real decision, the struggle
will soon be renewed and the two "Leagues of Nations" will engage in
another massacre.

On both sides subjection and slaughter of the working people of the
world.

**And in any case slaughter and oppression for the proletariats. That is
the future**.

Worker, choose! Both sides decoy you with their League of Nations. Both
say: "We are not Imperialistic; it is the others who are!" But, indeed,
both threaten you with subjection and destruction.

If one should ask the workers which they would prefer -- the despotism,
the brutality, the carnage of German Imperialism; or the brutality of
the American, united with the refined exploitation of English
Imperialism, through which the blood bath always comes -- the workers
would reply: "We don't know: the results of both are alike frightful."

So it is.

The German and the Anglo-American Imperialisms are indeed alike terrible
for the proletariat.

The German, English, and American, and **all** other proletariats on
earth are threatened in the same manner and in the same measure by
German and English-American Imperialism.

But the workers can also unite. They can form a League in which one
national proletariat will stand up for the other; a League like a Trade
Union, or a Trust of workers, who will fight together against world
Imperialism; for their interests are really the same.

Only the combined English, German and American proletariats, and
therefore only the combined proletariats of the world, can destroy
German and English-American Imperialism -- can destroy Imperialism
generally, world Imperialism.

Every national, and also the whole international, proletariat must fight
energetically against **both**. The workers of all countries must have a
united front. They will then be able to attack and destroy **both** at
the same time.

They must establish an International to destroy both at the same time.

The two great Imperialisms are of the same stamp. And since the
Imperialisms of all nations in the world are united with, or subject to,
these two -- Germany on one hand, England and America on the other -- so
it is true that for all the workers on earth, for the whole world
proletariat, the Imperialism of both groups, and Imperialism in general,
are alike terrible.

Therefore it is certain that the workers of the world will again be
oppressed and destroyed by Imperialism. And because of more slaughter
and more oppression by Imperialism (for no matter how the war ends it is
certain that the proletariats of the world will be again oppressed and
sacrificed), therefore a revolt of the workers of the world is
necessary.

But international Imperialism cannot be overthrown unless international
Capitalism is also overthrown.

The Revolution, the social world revolution, against Capitalism is
therefore necessary for the world proletariat.

We shall prove this in the first place.

All those who prefer one Imperialism to another stand in a false
position.

They divide the international proletariat and make its victory over
Imperialism impossible. They are all, whether social-patriots,
psuedo-Marxists [sic], or parties in neutral countries, playing the game
of the German and English-American Imperialists, and of the
international Capitalist classes, and Governments.

They stand on the side of these classes and Governments and assist
Imperialism.

They divide and distinguish two groups of Imperialism -- the
English-American under the mask of democracy; German under the mask of
absolutism -- for the purpose of showing the proletariat that their own
brand of Imperialism has not come to stay; or that it is only out to
obtain peace, or that the enemy Imperialism is the only Imperialism, or
to show that it is much worse than their own. This is done by Wilson,
Bethmann-Holweg, von Kuhlman, Lloyd George, Poincare, Czernin, Asquith.
This is the object of their speeches; by this deception alone are they
able to declare war and continue it; by this alone can they support it;
and these Socialists help them to do it.

But only by one united world proletariat can world Imperialism be
defeated.

The position is really similar to the internal politics of the national
ruling classes, who separate the workers by the watchwords, Liberal,
Clerical, Conservative, Democrat, etc. -- watchwords which, under
Imperialism, are fast disappearing. They are now being divided into more
gigantic masses, into world-masses -- Imperialists and workers; into
supporters of the Workers' International, and supporters of this or that
Imperialism.

German Imperialism, as the cruellest and most brutal run by an
autocracy, takes the place of the Conservatives and Reactionaries.

English-American Imperialism, as more deceitful and more hypocritical,
governed by a so-called democracy, takes the place of the Liberals.

In reality they are both alike.

The Great Imperialists -- the Kaisers, the Kings, the Presidents, the
Governors, of the English, American and German banks; the Ministers and
Politicians -- know well what they are about. They know that, through
these divisions, and through these divisions alone (for the proletariat
is already so powerful that were it united internationally it would
destroy the Imperialism of all States, would destroy Imperialism
itself), by Splitting the proletariat into two groups, will they be able
to accomplish their aim. That aim is a great and lasting victory for
Bank Capital, and the placing of the world under its control.

The proletariat as a whole must unite against Imperialism as a whole --
against all Imperialisms. This can only be done if the proletariat
realises that the German and English-American international Imperialisms
are the same; if it is not to be as formerly, Liberal over Clerical; if
one Imperialism is not to be looked upon as a "lesser evil" than the
other, and set up over the other; if it is not to be an alliance with
one, then there will not be a national, but an international reformism.
In national politics, to set up Liberalism over Conservatism, or
Conservatism over Clericalism, is national reformism. In international
politics, to set up Democratic Imperialism over Absolutist Imperialism,
is "international reformism." It is a weakness of mind on the part of
the proletariat to hope that one part of Capitalism, the democratic
part, is in a position to make "reforms" or settle questions that only
Socialism is in a position to do.

Just as those who, in the nation placed Liberal over Clerical politics,
prevent the national unity of the proletariat; so those who place
English-American Imperialism over German prevent the unity of the
international proletariat.

National and international reformism ought both to be strongly opposed
and destroyed.

The main thing for the proletariat is a realisation of the fact that
both Imperialisms are alike; that their aims and their effects are alike
destructive; and, realising this, to unite for the destruction of both.

## Chapter 2: No Other Way out for the World's Proletariat

"The Imperialism of both groups is alike terrible for the proletariat.

It can only be destroyed by a united world proletariat.

The world revolution is therefore a necessity."

This that we said in the first chapter should be sufficient. It should
be sufficient that all Imperialisms, that the Imperialisms of both
groups of all nations, are alike terrible for the proletariat, and that
therefore the proletariat of all nations ought to unite to destroy
Imperialism.

We should go on to prove that the destruction of Imperialism, the world
revolution, is possible for the proletariat if the governments, the
bourgeoisie, the social-patriots, and the pseudo-Marxists of all
countries, the Majority and Minority in France and Italy, the Majority
and the Independents of Germany, the Labour Party and the pacifist
Socialists in England, and all the great Socialist parties of the United
States -- in short, all Capitalists and all Socialists in the world,
with the exception of the real revolutionaries, had not made it appear
to the workers that between Socialism and Imperialism there was still
another way out.

They had told the workers that after the war Imperialism and
Imperialistic Capitalism would bring about disarmament, compulsory
arbitration, a League of Nations, and a general peace. The Capitalists,
the social-patriots, the psuedo-Marxists [sic], the Labour Party and the
pacifist Socialists in England, the Majority and the Independents in
Germany, the Majority and the Minority in France and Italy, and the
Socialists in the United States, said this in order to hold back the
world proletariat from revolution.

It was represented to them that if Capitalism was able to stop the war,
it would be able to develop peacefully, and the world revolution would
not then be necessary.

Since these representations have a powerful counter-revolutionary
significance, especially on account of the number and the power of those
who make them, it is the duty of every revolutionary to prove again and
again that they are false.

Before going on to show the practicability of a revolution we shall
state what will happen.

In all Capitalistic States, in all Capitalistic nations, millions and
millions of workers in their own countries and in the Colonies will
produce quantities of new surplus wealth every year.

This mass of wealth will grow continually greater year by year, and will
be added to the old capital.

There are still many countries in the world with great natural treasures
and weak populations, from whom colossal profits can be extracted.

New capital seeks these fields of exploitation.

This is the cause of Imperialism.

All the countries of the earth already have masters.

The earth is already divided up.

The nations must fight to get the best places.

This is the cause of Imperialist wars.

There are three particular Capitalistic States whose mass of capital has
grown so large that they quarrel with each other in every corner of the
earth for profit.

These are England, Germany, and the United States.

The millions of workers in England, Germany, and the United States of
America, have worked so hard for so many years with such unceasing
energy that the Capitalists in these countries aim at the monopoly of
world power.

These three gigantic nations now fight really for the domination of the
world.

Do not say that this picture is overdrawn, that no one nation or group
of nations will ever be able to succeed in dominating the world. For the
nature of capital is such that it creates ever more surplus wealth, that
it can produce unlimited quantities of surplus wealth if it can only
obtain ever more workers, raw materials, and machines. Every powerful
Capitalist State, every powerful Capitalist nation, feels, therefore,
that if it had only more countries subject to it, the existence of
capital gives to it the possibility of at last being able to conquer the
world.

These three giants rise out of the struggle of all Capitalist nations.

And two of them, England -- and by this name we mean the British World
Empire, England with her Colonies and dominions -- and the United States
have combined, perhaps for a long time, perhaps for a short time,
perhaps for ever, in order to strive for the domination of the world.

And as in the economic struggle, the most powerful syndicates ultimately
absorb the smaller companies, so also these three great powers unite all
the lesser ones in two groups in order to carry on the world
struggle^[With the intention of making the problem of the world war and
disarmament perfectly clear, we have tried to simplify the struggle by
confining it to the three greatest nations. As a matter of fact, the
struggle is much more complex: it embraces all the nations of the world;
and on that account the settlement of the problem by peaceful means
makes it still more impossible. In the pamphlet, "Imperialism, the World
War and Social Democracy" (pages 119-142) we have made this perfectly
clear. There also we have shown the economic causes that make a world
peace and a League of Nations impossible. If in the future England and
the United States should become separated that would not alter the fact
that we are now subject to World-Imperialism. Each of these States would
then try to obtain world domination; each would set about forming new
groups and would arrange new alliances (for example, say with Germany or
Japan). They would then do just as they are doing now.].

The development of Capitalism has reached its highest point. Only a few
gladiators remain in the arena.

International Capitalism now approaches the struggle through which it
will be brought to an end.

And just as the struggles of the small cities in the Middle Ages
resulted in the formation of the little Medieval States; and just as the
struggle between these little States resulted in the formation of great
national States -- so now there is being formed, as a result of the
struggle between the great; national States, the two groups, the great
alliances, the two Leagues of Nations.

In and through the struggles of the medieval cities arose the power of
the small burgher or citizen.

In and through the struggles of the national States arose the power of
the great bourgeoisie. In and through the struggles of the groups of
nations arose the power of the great Capitalists, of the monopolists of
industry, of the banks and of the trusts.

And just as the burghers and the bourgeoisie arose through the struggles
of the princes, the nobles and the Church, so also will arise now, out
of the struggle of all the Capitalist nations, out of the struggles of
the monopolist who wish to dominate all countries, another, a third
power -- the proletariat of the world.

And whilst the two greatest powers of the earth, the two groups of all
the Capitalistic nations, and the monopolists of all lands struggle for
the domination of the world, the world proletariat will rise up against
them and become masters of the world.

Capitalism, having attained its highest point, blossomed into monopoly,
and in its struggle for the monopoly of the earth it shall be destroyed
by the proletariat.

In its perfect bloom, its last and greatest straining every muscle,
developed to the highest pitch to struggle for the monopoly of world
power, it is broken in the struggle for its existence, and out of the
last blaze of its power a new world stands forth.

Capitalism began with private ownership.

The few Capitalists have grown through the possession of capital into a
numerous and powerful class. This has developed into, the possession of
all capital and its direction by a few.

And it dies in full bloom. The blossoms fall and the new world steps
forth.

The workers at the end of the eighteenth Century united to fight their
employers. The Socialists in the middle of the nineteenth Century united
in national parties to fight the national bourgeoisie. They now unite
internationally to fight the international bourgeoisie.

And in this unity they will conquer.

Why do not the national Capitalists unite with each other? Why do not
Germany, England and the United States unite? Why do they not work
together for the exploitation of all the workers -- and of all the
world? For then their power would be much greater; they would not need
to fight with one another, and they would be able to prevent the
proletariat from fighting, perhaps, for the revolution.

The answer is, firstly: Their capitals are national and not
international. The international capitals in comparison with the
national capitals are only a very small part of capital.

And secondly: The national Capitalists have different interests and
different aims.

What are their aims? What are the aims of the three great nations? As we
have already said, Germany wants to subjugate Belgium, Poland, France,
Russia, Austria-Hungary, the Balkans, Turkey, Asia Minor, Armenia,
Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia, perhaps Siberia, and other parts of Asia,
thus making the first step towards world domination. Established on the
coasts of the Indian Ocean she is then ready for the second world war to
capture India, the Pacific Ocean, and all the countries bordering it;
then Africa, and the domination of the world.

England wants to spread her World Empire over Africa, through Asia to
India.

The United States want to rule on the Pacific Ocean, in China, in the
Indian Archipelago, in Polynesia, in Central and South America, and
perhaps in the northern part of Asia. Then England and the United States
will rule almost the **whole world**.

And by what means can the three reach their goal, world domination?

As we have already said, Germany through the union of Europe under her
leadership: the United States and the English World Empire through the
breaking up of Europe.

And how will they obtain these means?

By fighting, by war.

Just imagine to yourselves, workers of Europe and America, workers of
the world, whom they want to deceive and keep under Capitalism, and hold
back from revolution with the hope that world peace, disarmament, and a
League of Nations are possible -- just imagine to yourselves that the
war is ended. Imagine that the slaughter of humanity is over. Imagine in
the first place that England and America have won. Then are Africa and
Asia, Central and South America, and all the world markets, practically
in their power; and the Continent of Europe is helpless.

Then imagine to yourselves that Germany has won. Then Germany has a part
of Africa and stands before the gates of India, and probably also before
those of China.

Then imagine to yourselves that neither of them has won. Then the
situation is the same as before the war.

Place these three cases -- the only three possibilities -- clearly
before your eyes, and ask yourself then: Will there be no more, wars
after this one?

If England and the United States win, will a weakened and broken-up
Europe suffer that? Will Germany not place herself at the head of Europe
and try to rise again?

And now put the second case clearly before your eyes. Germany at the end
of the war, after "peace has been signed, stands at the gates of India
and China, and within the gates stand the English and American powers.

What will happen? Think upon it, workers. Will England and the United
States not try to drive Germany back?

Now place the third case before your eyes. The war ends without a
decision. There is no victor and no vanquished. Then all remain as they
were before the war -- Germany encircled by England and her Allies, and
continuing to arm and prepare for the world war. Will Germany now
disarm, and will England and America refrain from pressing her?

Consider how these great powers jostle each other now. They stand on one
another's borders. Remember that on the other side of their boundaries
lie countries that offer splendid opportunities for Capitalist
Exploitation at the highest possible profit. Remember that the two
groups want the same lands -- Africa and Asia, and now Russia. Remember
that these countries are abundantly rich, and yet almost unexploited.
Millions, nay, billions, there await the exploiter. Worker, remember the
nature of capital. Its substance is spreading in ever greater
quantities. Consider that through your labour and through that of all
the peoples subject to, or allied with, the two groups, the power of
capital continually increases. The two groups stand facing each other on
the frontiers. Within their boundaries is the ever-growing mass of
capital. And without lies the booty -- Profit.

What do you think, then? Will there be another war?

You can give no other answer but yes.

So long as the Capitalists of Germany, England, and the United States
have different aims and want to possess the same countries and to
dominate the world; so long as they remain national and not
international, there will be war.

The possibility of disarmament, of the League of Nations, of general
peace, has been refuted. Enough has been said for any discerning worker.

But since the blood-dripping Governments, the Capitalists, the Social
Patriots, and the pseudo-Marxists, still seek by many arguments to
betray and deceive the workers, we are obliged to attack and expose
them.

The Governments and bourgeois parties of all countries, the Social
Patriots and false radicals, the Majority and the Independent Socialists
in Germany, the Majority and Minority in France, the Labour Party and
the Pacifist Socialists in England, and all the great Socialist Parties
in the United States who propagate the ideas of peace, disarmament, or
the reduction of armaments, all those who made the war, or permitted it,
all must show how these are possible and in what way they can be
accomplished. They ought to show, not by hollow phrases, but by facts,
what they think about the Peace arrangements.

Which parts of the earth ought England, Germany, or the United States,
to receive?

Which parts should go to the little nations, or to France, Italy, Japan,
Austria, Hungary, Turkey, etc.? They ought to show this on the map so
that everybody can see that it is right and just, and that no new wars
shall come out of the Treaty. They should show in what manner the
territories should be divided, and how confidence can be established
among the various nations, so that they may discontinue military
preparations.

Workers, they are unable to do this. When asked to deal with concrete
facts they refuse. Up to the present time nobody has been able to define
boundaries on the map which would give satisfaction to every Power.
Their talk is specious -- empty words -- hollow catch-phrases without
significance. President Wilson, the sanguinary humanitarian of the
United States, and all the Capitalist Governments, never cease to mouth
the phrases, Justice! Freedom! Right!

The Governments of the bourgeoisie, the reformists dripping with blood,
say: "Establish a political Trust of Nations similar to the economic
trusts formed by the Capitalists. This would obviate competition, and
the nations would work together, but in different spheres. In this way
England, Germany, and the United States, of America, would divide up the
world and establish a Trust for their profit."

This comparison with Trusts is misleading. There is a most decided
difference. One which has prevented States in ancient times from forming
a Trust for the exploitation of the world.

The difference is this: The economic trust deals with dead things; with
gold and merchandise. These it can easily rule nationally and
internationally.

But States are living forms comprised of human beings, and everything
that lives develops. Thus it would happen, even were a satisfactory
division and regulation arrived at, that after a short time conditions
would alter. The economic and capital power would change so that one of
the masters would be more powerful than the others; or the subject
nation would become strong enough to shake off the yoke and become
masters themselves. Then we should have another war.

Human beings cannot be united in such a Trust or League. The nations of
old, who aimed at world power, tried it and failed. It cannot be done
now.

The hypocritical bourgeoisie and the German Government, who have
murdered thousands, yes, tens of thousands, of sailors, give out the
cry: "The Freedom of the Seas. Give us that and war will end." But in
peace time the seas were free. The war has made no difference in that
respect.

The gory Capitalists and Governments, who began the war on account of
profit and trade competition, say: "Free Trade -- give us Free Trade, no
preferential tariffs or taxes -- then shall we have peace."

But how do they establish trade in primitive countries -- in Central
Africa? By Force, by Murder and War!

This war only decides who shall carry the weapons; who shall perpetrate
the murders -- Germany or England.

Business prospers best where the business people have political power.
If these primitive countries are free to all alike, a struggle for
political power must ensue sooner or later.

Trade, however, is no longer the principal object. This is now Capital
Export; the making of new capital. It expresses itself in roads,
harbours, factories and railways.

How does this Imperialism realise itself in Asia and Africa; how are the
arrangements for Capitalist production brought about, with its
consequent expropriation and proletarising of the natives? By force! And
war alone will decide which particular nation shall be the expropriator.

The tender pacifists and those Socialists who, by their pacifism
hypnotised the workers and helped to cause the war, they also are
dripping with blood. They say: "The costs of another world-war would be
too great in money and men." But the millions for the conquest of Africa
and Asia will bring their fruit in the shape of billions of interest.

Italy, Roumania, and the United States of America did not enter the war
**before** they knew what it would cost.

Is not this demand for unity laughable so long as the interests and
strength of the nations are so decidedly different; when so many weak
nations can be quite easily destroyed? Is it not ridiculous?

If England and the United States of America believe they are able to
seize everything, why should they ally themselves with Germany? If
Germany wins, why should she not trust in the improvement of weapons of
war to obtain more? If the British Empire and the United States of
America possess within themselves almost inexhaustible sources of
wealth, why should they unite with others and divide with them their
profits, which may expand enormously?

So long as Germany believes she can shatter opposition by her military
power, why should she share her power with others?

So long as there remain such extensive territories for Capitalism to
conquer -- as China, the Near East, Lower India, parts of Central Asia,
and of Africa -- so long as there remain so many weak nations to
subject, just so long will States trust in their own power and worship
the idol of their own Imperialism.

Should Germany conquer England or the United States of America, those
States would inevitably revolt again. And if either of the former beat
Germany, she, too, would never endure it, but would rise again.

It is obvious that the opposing national interests will prevent a League
of Nations being anything but a sham. There will, indeed, be established
"Leagues of Nations," but they will be but alliances of special groups,
and will have as their object the more vigorous exploitation of weaker
nations and to carry on war against rivals.

The phrase-mongers, the Capitalist Governments, the false Socialists in
all lands, all those who for the sake of their country betrayed the
cause of peace -- they say: "Establish an International Police Force
from amongst the nations, which shall punish all aggressors; and a High
Court of Arbitration which shall decide who is guilty."

This is the most absurd proposal of all, for there is no surer method of
advancing competition in armaments than this.

The Capitalist State, like man, is sinful. It was born of ambition, and
gain and lust. These are the original sins of Capitalism, to which it is
predestined through the "fall" of private property.

Every State will be afraid to sin for fear of a united attack by the
others. Because of this it must prepare a defence against all the others
in order to attain its ambitions. It must develop an army and navy
capable of combatting them all. They all know that "interests" will
dominate their judgment, and they know also that it is possible for the
decision to be in favour of an offender. They know that their interests
may be on the side of an offender, and they would then defend him and
oppose the League. With this eventuality before them they would prepare
huge armies and navies. They will arm and fight as before, only
including the "International Police" in their armoury of cant-phrases.

"Self-Determination for Nations" is another cry of these complacent
humbugs. "If only every nation were independent or voluntarily united,
then the prime cause of war will disappear."

But the Great War shows that the opposite is the case. Existing small
nations like Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, etc., or possible
nations like Poland, Esthonia, Courland, and Finland -- all would still
be bones of contention amongst the great Powers.

The Russian Revolution has surely made the right of Self-Determination
one of the bases of the Revolution; they have made it one of their
principles: but with this vital difference -- they introduce Socialism
at the same time. Without Self-Determination they could not have
effected the Revolution. But they showed also that Self-Determination
under Imperialism was impossible.

And if it be said that the Self-Determination promised by Germany is
only an appearance, even so can it be said of England and America. It
will separate the nations from one another and perpetuate their
weakness. This sort of Independence can be even worse for a nation than
subjection.

It will be shown in a most terrible way that Self-Determination can only
follow and not precede Socialism.

Capitalism, and especially Imperialism, cannot settle the question of
nationality. Either they must grant the small nations independence, in
which case they become the envy of the large nations, or subject and
annex them.

Germany follows the latter method in Europe. She wants the whole of
Europe under her domination in order to light England.

England and the United States of America follow the first method. They
want Europe to remain weak, with no great Power on the Continent, and
whilst small nations are quarrelling amongst themselves, to build up a
colonial system and world domination without hindrance.

Capitalism is here in a cleft-stick. It cannot grant independence to
small nations without making them objects of war; it cannot unite them
without subjecting them; and in either case it plants the seed of
another world-war.

The Capitalist Governments and their underlings all say: "Disarmament by
degrees." But how can they disarm whilst they continue to threaten one
another?

How can Germany disarm when her enemies dominate the world and have made
Europe powerless? It would be suicide -- it would ruin Europe.

As we are of a different opinion to some of our comrades who belong to
the Extreme Left, and as this question is closely related to the whole
problem of the liberation of the workers from Imperialism and war, we
would like to go a little deeper into it.

Many Socialists propose as a means of bringing the war to an end the
formula: "No Annexations and no indemnities." But these conditions
cannot be put forward by the proletariat of the world; for their
fulfilment would leave Capitalism exactly where it is, and could be
followed only by new arming and new wars.

But even revolutionary demands, as demands, which the working class may
put forward to upset the Government and simplify the revolution; even
these are of no avail, for as soon as a Government gets into a tight
corner it will adopt these demands itself (as Germany did in 1917),
announce them as its own aims, and retort to the workers: "See, our
demands are yours," and thereby break the revolution.

"No annexations and no indemnities" does not provide a way out.

That is the horror of the situation, and nothing shows more clearly the
catastrophic nature of the crisis to which Imperialism has brought
society.

Capitalist nations cannot arrive at any peace between themselves,
neither during the war nor after.

They are compelled at all times to wade deeper in the blood-bath. The
proletariat under Imperialism can only have Imperialistic peace or
Imperialistic war; and every Imperialist war means a new and more
dreadful Imperialism; and every Imperialistic peace means a new and more
dreadful war.

There is only one way out of Imperialism, and war: the Revolution.

The Capitalist Governments, of England, France, and the United States of
America, together with those pretended Socialists who threw away their
power and gave themselves completely to the Military General Staffs; who
made no real attempt to secure peace -- **they** are entirely
responsible for the war; **they** are the servants of the General
Staffs, and, like them, reek with blood. They talk "Democracy." If only
we had democracy established in Germany and Austria-Hungary, the
democracies of the world would make peace. But the plutocratic Republic
of France is a "democracy," and world-dominating Britain is a
"democracy," and America, land of trusts and monopolies, armed
strike-breakers who organise legal murders of the workers' leaders, is
also a "democracy." Have they done anything to prevent war? No! England,
through her policy under Edward VII of encircling Germany, helped to
bring it on. America joined in as soon as she discovered that it was a
fight for world-domination. And will these democracies make peace if
they win? If Germany and a stricken Europe threaten them with war, or if
the Allies are beaten and Germany at the head of all the nations of
Europe threatens them still further, will they make peace? No!

In the making of capital abroad, absolute Monarchies and democratic
Republics are alike. In the greed of power, the lust of profit, all
nations are alike.

Monarchies and democracies under Imperialism are hells, full of the same
damnation: expansion over the world, the fight for world domination.

Monarchies, principalities, and democratic Parliaments, all are equally
obedient servants of Imperialist Capitalism and financial interests.
Both of these want war, and the institutions are tools in their hands.
These two interests, through their representatives on the Governments
and General Staffs, dictate to the Parliaments what must be done. The
Parliaments and other institutions only possess power so long as they
are obedient to the Capitalist forces.

This power will only be overthrown by the triumph of the peoples, and
until the workers themselves obtain control, world peace is impossible.

The best example of the truth of this assertion is to be seen in
President Wilson, the servant of the American trusts and monopolies,
which, in order to secure world-power for themselves, are building
armies and fleets powerful enough to secure victory in all future wars.

These are the principal solutions which the Governments, Social
Patriots, and pseudo-Socialists propose to lead Capitalism out of
Imperialism.

We have shown them to be false, that none of them stand a moment's
investigation by a clear and searching eye. Theoretically, the
investigation shows no way out of Imperialism for Capitalism. But the
proletariat should not depend upon theory alone, but also on realities.

Already the earth trembles under new wars. Germany has Poland and
Belgium and part of France in her power. She has broken up Russia, taken
possession of the Ukraine, the Caucasus and Finland; annexed Livonia,
Esthonia and Courland, and reduced Greater Russia to helplessness. She
will do the same with the rest of Europe. This has been approved not
only by the Monarchists of Germany, but by the Democrats and Social
Democrats as well -- at least by the Majority.

England and America will not suffer this. Is this world peace? Is this
disarmament? This is an assurance, an absolute assurance, of a new war.

If America and England are victorious they will make all the nations of
Europe independent. They have openly stated their intention to do so.

This means they will break Europe up into small pieces and allow
internal jealousies full play; that they will create internal hells in
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Poland, the Balkans, and Russia; and thus
become undisputed masters of the world. That is the aim of their
hypocritical Lloyd George and President Wilson. All the Parties agree
with them, not only the Conservatives, but also the Democrats and the
Socialist Majorities. Europe will never suffer that. It will rise under
the leadership of Germany and fight. Is this world peace? World
arbitration and disarmament? No! It is an absolute assurance of a new
world war -- of a succession of world wars.

**Proletarians take heed**! Notice only the realities about you. Look at
the war volcanoes blazing around you in Europe, Alsace-Lorraine, Poland,
Russia, the Balkans, Asia, and also in Africa.

Imperialism remains, competition in armaments remains, war remains.

Workers! Remember that: the Governments and the Social Patriots said all
these things before the war.

Remember, proletariat of the world, that they want to deceive you again,
and that after this war they will make a new compromise, a new alliance
with the bourgeoisie. Remember, workers, that the great social
democratic Parties at their Congress in Copenhagen and Basle spoke about
world peace and general disarmament. What good has it done? None; war
has broken out again.

Remember, workers, proletariat of the world, that by these watchwords,
world peace, disarmament, etc., have the bourgeoisie kept their power
over you. Through these watchwords they held you back from revolution.

The bourgeoisie knew when you accepted these watch-words that you agreed
to try peaceful means, and that you had given up the only real means --
revolution against war. They also knew that they could make war without
any danger of your rising in revolt, and, therefore, they have made this
war. These watchwords enabled them to do so.

Workers, will you continue to be befooled by such catch-phrases? Will
you be deceived again by the Capitalists and their Governments, and
their henchmen, the false Socialists?

The Czar of Russia and all the Governments held a Conference at the
Hague, and said they wanted to found a Court of Arbitration. That was
only to deceive you.

By these devices they have led you and kept you in the grip of war.

The Social Patriots have urged you to "fight for world peace and
disarmament."

By this means they brought you into the war, and in July-August, 1914,
held you back from revolution, because you we re not prepared for
revolution; you had placed your hopes in disarmament and world peace.

They have trapped you into the war by their watch-words. Will you accept
them again and go to war?

That is impossible, for by so doing you will be causing a third war, and
perhaps further wars.

It is the use of these watchwords which help to continue the war and
increase the slaughter. They restrain you from revolution by promising
disarmament, world peace, and a League of Nations when once peace is
established, and they vote the war credits without opposition.

Trusting their promises you say: "Let us see it through, for surely the
better thing will come." But your hopes are false, and, through these
very hopes is the slaughter maintained and intensified.

During and after the war these watchwords will be more deceptive than
formerly, for war has bred hat red deep into the hearts of the nations,
drawn them further apart, made their interests more opposing and
conflicting, and, as we have already shown, created fresh causes of war.

The mass of capital grows; need for expansion increases; the interest in
new wars becomes more powerful in all parts of the world. New world-wars
are much more certain than before this one commenced.

Will you allow yourselves again to be deluded by their catch-phrases?

They have given you a false picture of the world peace. Just because of
that came the world war, and what is worse, the war of the workers
against one another. They gave a false picture of the League of Nations,
and as a consequence have split the proletariat into national parties.

Will you allow yourselves to be deceived again? If you do, another war
will come, more frightful than was this, with a fresh Splitting of the
proletariat.

There was but one way out of this war, and there is but one way of
saving us from it -- the working class Revolution.

Workers, the Capitalists of the world have organised themselves into
gigantic groups. In these groups they have concentrated their whole
strength for the conquest of the world for the purpose of fighting each
other for domination. In this struggle between the Powers, you, the
workers, will be oppressed and scattered, killed and maimed, for many
years to come. There is no way out for Capitalism from Imperialism.

The Capitalists, who can only survive by war, now organise in two groups
to fight for the mastery of the world -- they can find no way out, but
stick fast in the mire.

Workers of the world, the way out of war and Imperialism does not lie
through "Justice," "Freedom of the Seas," "Free Trade," "Peace without
Annexations or Indemnities," "League of Nations," "Compulsory
Arbitration," or "The Right of Self-Determination." These are all lies
and deceitful frauds used to bind you tighter to Imperialism and to
strengthen it.

There is no Justice for you or yours in Capitalism.

There is only one Justice for you.

There is only one Freedom -- the freedom of the proletariat.

There is only one Peace -- that is Communism.

There is no Capitalist path from Imperialism, but there is a proletarian
way; that is to overthrow Capitalism. You can do this if you, the
workers, are united in one great World League; then you can destroy the
Imperialisms of the entire world.

The Revolution -- the World Revolution -- that, and that only is the way
out.

Imperialism cannot be overthrown except by the destruction of
Capitalism.

This is no prophecy -- it is only the plain, unvarnished truth -- a
truth verified in actuality by the Russian Revolution.

## Chapter 3: The Feasability of the Revolution

Socialism emerges from the seas of blood and lies in which the world has
been submerged by Capitalist Imperialism.

Out of the struggle between the Great Powers of the world comes the
proletariat and pits its strength against Capitalism.

The proletariat will win in this fight, and will establish Communism,
for Communism is the base of our existence, the foundation on which
rested for many generations the existence of humanity.

The period of individualism, of private property, is as a moment
compared with the centuries of Tribal Communism. Now, the old foundation
of human existence is found again.

Communism, from which everything that is useful has developed, all our
wealth, all that is noble in the hearts of men, will be set up again.
Communism, of which the great philosophers like Plato have dreamt;
Communism which was the seed and aim of the early Christians; Communism
which is described and depicted in the sacred pictures of all great
religions; Communism, for which all the poor and oppressed classes have
struggled throughout the period of private ownership up to our own
times; Communism which was imagined by our Utopists; for which our
comrades of all lands have given their lives; the Communism which our
great leader, Karl Marx, foresaw, knew, and understood, the modern
Communism based on scientific knowledge, of which he laid the foundation
stone; this now comes forth in all its wonder and beauty.

And we "blessed ones" can see it and fight for it. Already it lives in
one country -- Russia, and like a golden flame spreads the light of
revolution over all the world.

If the proletariat is united; if the proletariat of all lands unite, and
fight all Imperialisms as one, nothing can withstand them.

If, on the other hand, they do not now unite, the golden flame will be
extinguished and not re-kindled for many years.

It is now our task as theoreticians of the proletariat to examine with
clear eyes, and to demonstrate the feasibility of, the world revolution.

If a god had ordained the destiny of mankind, and if he had prescribed
the line of development, matters could not be better arranged by the
victory of Socialism.

Capitalism itself has developed the necessary basis for the victory.

How different everything has turned out from what our great master,
Marx, expected. Just as he had underestimated the power of Capitalism to
expand into monopoly and Imperialism, so had he underestimated the
mental, moral and material power that the workers would have to use in
order to destroy Capitalism. Neither did he see the new causes of war.

He believed that Capitalism would break down through an economic crisis,
and be displaced by the proletariat. Indeed, capital in its spread over
the world does come up against political obstacles^[Really through
economic causes, through over-production of capital and the existence of
rich countries with weak populations to which capital is exported,
forcing colonial or imperial politics and so dragging them into war.],
which it will only be able to overcome by curtailing its own power. This
will bring frightful sufferings to the workers, and these will lead to
the revolution -- to the overthrow of Capitalism.

Everything is now at hand and in alphabetical order that is necessary
for the revolution. There are many things here which make the revolution
feasible. Men and means -- material and spritual [sic] power for its
realisation, and the hunger need, the first and greatest -- indeed, the
one and only maker of revolution -- are here.

Not in one country alone, but throughout the whole world has suffering
come through the war. Hunger creates pain, revolt, and hate; pain on
account of loss and destruction, revolt against the Capitalist class,
and hate against Capitalism above all else.

The human and psychological factors that make for revolution are here,
and they will develop the longer the war lasts.

The material means are here because Capitalism has centralised
production, and the transport and distribution of goods.

Miracle upon miracle. The material productive powers introduced by
Capitalism during the war are no longer the weapons with which
Capitalism can reconstruct [read defend] a Capitalist State.

It is as though a god or wizard had touched them with a magic wand, and
transformed them from Capitalist instruments into proletarian
instruments for an entirely different state of society.

Capitalism, Imperialism, and the war have made the necessary material
and psychological conditions for Socialism. They have done more -- they
have fleeced and robbed each other, and they now confront the
proletariat weaker than ever before; they can no longer govern. They
have placed weapons of war in the hands of the proletariat; weapons
which can be used to destroy Capitalism. The proletariat is armed.

One after another countries are being annexed, oppressed, and robbed of
their freedom. They can only obtain a return of this freedom through the
triumph of the working class. These countries weaken Capitalism, and
strengthen Socialism.

It has been shown during the war how quickly the foundations of society
can be changed, and if the most reactionary power, Czardom, can be
overthrown, that, more than anything else, is a great moral example.

That example -- the Russian Revolution -- stands before the workers now.
It has produced the first great proletarian revolutionary leaders.

It is now our task to examine, separately and closely, these spiritual
and material means in order that the international proletariat may see
that the revolution is possible, and may thus hasten it.

In speaking about the feasibility of the revolution, we would remark
that there is no difference between revolution during the war and after
the war. So far as it is possible to judge by appearance, the revolution
will come during the war; through defeat, through hunger, through the
endless bloodshed from which there is no escape.

In all countries the revolutionary proletariat must rise against their
own Governments, and demand and enforce immediate peace. Secondly, they
must have an international understanding, and to have this they must
establish a new International.

If the representatives of the revolutionary workers in all countries
could meet together, and call a general strike in the munition
factories, and demand that the soldiers cease fighting^[This was done in
1917 by the Zimmerwaldians in Stockholm.] against the external enemy --
then, indeed, the revolution would be an accomplished fact.

When we speak of the World Revolution, though we mean all countries in
the world, we have England and Germany especially in mind, for there the
material conditions are most ripe for Socialism. In other countries the
revolution will break out and conquer; but it is certain if the
revolution in England and Germany wins, the victory will be made easier
for the rest of the world.

And, thirdly, it should be said here that we do not prophecy the
duration of the revolution or its character; for it is possible that the
fight which Socialism will have to wage against Capitalism, Militarism,
and Imperialism, may last for years. It is also possible that Socialism
may win speedily. The power of the contending classes is great, and the
incentive strong; but as to the duration of the fight we will say
nothing, simply calling the whole struggle the revolution. As to the
method of the revolution there is nothing positive to say.

Karl Marx presumed it possible for the revolution to take place without
force in England. Who does not heartily wish this could be so
everywhere? Who would not hope that an end could be put to all strife
and suffering without the spilling of a drop of blood? But in all
countries, England included, the opposing classes are armed, and a
forcible revolution seems inevitable everywhere^[However, if the English
proletariat wished, and rose like one man in revolt, it would at least
be possible to establish the Revolution without a long or bitter
struggle.].

We speak, then, of the revolution in a general sense, including
peaceable and forcible methods, of long or short duration, during or
after the war.

Now, as to the practicability of the revolution.

The Capitalist State, the better to conduct the war, was forced to take
over the control of the world production and distribution -- the coal
mines, railways, agriculture, shipping, banks, etc.

It had the distribution of food supplies and raw materials in its hands.

This was so in both belligerent and neutral nations.

That which people declared to be impossible, and which the reformists
repudiated -- one great central control of wealth production and
distribution in the Capitalist State -- is realised. It is with us.

Stern necessity has enforced in three years of war what more than
half-a-century of peace could not have accomplished -- social control of
labour.

Socialism rests on the social control of labour, of production, of
distribution. Therefore the foundations for Socialism are laid.
Capitalism in its highest development has laid the foundation for
Socialism -- the central control of world production and distribution.

The workers now find to their hands the means to establish and build up
Socialism. In proof of this there stands clearly another fact. In all
countries before the war there were innumerable small businesses, each
working independently of the others; and many large establishments did
likewise.

During the war vast numbers of them, either voluntarily or by State
compulsion, amalgamated in trusts and combines.

The proletariat must take control of these now centralised means of
production. They must never allow industry, trade, agriculture,
transport, and the banks, to again revert to the hands of Capitalist
owners.

It must be said here that production and distribution are questions, of
general economy, and they will remain so. But during the war they have
been taken under the control of the State, although the instruments of
production were not the property of the State, these still belonging to
the private owners -- the Capitalists.

The State in the hands of the Capitalists is used as a means of
oppressing and exploiting the workers. If it directs production and
distribution in any way, then it does so in the interests of
Capitalists, and it is to them that the profits will go. Its function is
to rob the worker.

This must be altered. The proletariat of the world, of England and
Germany in particular, must see to it that private property and
interests, whether vested in the State or individuals, are overthrown.

But how can this be done if the Capitalists are all-powerful in the
State; are, in fact, the State itself?

There is no other way but to conquer political power and establish the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat.

You must destroy the power of the old State, and in its stead set up the
new State-power of the workers. You must change the dictatorship of the
Capitalist States into that of the proletariat.

That this is feasible we will show later on -- but we must first
recognise that the necessary material is here.

Having demonstrated that the material conditions are here, we have now
to show that the proletariat must seize political power, on personal,
human, and psychological grounds.

During this war Capitalism has destroyed much of its productive
machinery. Millions of workers have been killed, many more helplessly
crippled, and widows and orphans now form a large proportion of the
population in all countries.

Scarcely any goods are being produced. There is a shortage of raw
material. Machinery stands idle or has become useless. All industry is
diverted to war purposes. The means of transport are in a wretched
state; whole fleets of ships lie at the bottom of the sea. Fields are
untilled or badly cultivated, and are producing much less than formerly.
The supply of cattle is decreasing. The production of the necessaries of
life dwindles. Indeed, we are faced with a world famine. Small business
men are ruined by the million, and farmers have lost everything. Nations
are burdened with enormous debts, the interest on which exceeds in some
cases the total pre-war incomes.

The State can repudiate these debts; but that would ruin the
Capitalists. It can endeavour to pay them; but then they must bleed the
peoples dry. In either case the workers have a very poor outlook.

An economic and a financial crisis are approaching together. General
poverty will then come upon the whole world.

The demobilised soldiers will be confronted with unemployment. When
there is no raw material, or factories have been destroyed by war, where
are they to get work?

An economic war will inevitably follow the war of the military forces;
but in no case will the raw materials be available for industry, and
high prices must be the order of the day.

These terrible conditions will affect not only the working classes, but
also the small tradesmen and farmers. And along with these conditions we
shall have the new Imperialism, the preparations for the new war, whose
horrid spectre I have already described.

The psychological and spiritual conditions favouring revolution are not
less than the palpable or material.

People say, however, that the general poverty, misery, and scarcity of
raw material, machinery, and capital, will be an obstacle, not an aid,
to Socialism.

They evidently think that Socialism can only be established out of
riches and abundance. This is a very misleading argument, for out of
this disorder, poverty, and destruction, the Capitalist has to
reconstruct and make secure again its [read his] position. Capital and
Labour are confronted with the same material; and with so many elements
advantageous to revolution, and with the workers' thoughts always
turning in this direction, the greater possibility is on the side of
Labour. If the destruction is no obstacle to Capitalism, then it can be
no obstacle to Socialism.

This question, then, presents itself: Who is best able to establish a
new society? The answer is that the proletariat can much better and more
speedily establish Socialism than can the Capitalists reconstruct the
Capitalist system.

How will Capitalism go to work in its task? How will it deal with the
difficulties? It has a new economic system to set up. That means that it
will simply revert to the old one and create anew surplus wealth. It has
to produce more surplus wealth than ever in order to balance and exceed
its unproductive expenditure. At the same time it will have huge armies
to maintain, millions of unemployed to support, a host of crippled and
wounded from the war, together with widows and orphans. It will have, in
addition, an enormous debt to pay, and the cost of new preparations for
war to meet.

The founding of a new economy; the restoration of the old one; the
making of new gains greater than their losses; helping the crippled in
the war; interest on National Debt to pay; new armaments and military
establishments to maintain -- all this Capitalism has to face. And this
is an impossible feat for Capitalism. Why so? Because capital helps
capital and must save it. Because it cannot take from itself the
millions required for reconstruction, and thus expropriate itself.
Because production is for the few, not for the many. Because it is not
the duty of all men to produce.

It cannot divest itself of its capital and wealth in order to help the
poor and workless. It cannot annul or repudiate its debt or refuse to
pay the interest. It cannot tax itself to the extent now necessary. It
cannot prevent preparations for war, and thus liberate the productive
forces for useful work.

It cannot even stop luxury and permit the labour thus absorbed to be
diverted to useful channels.

It cannot in this great crisis set its productive forces going in a
sufficiently active manner -- just because it is itself. It cannot
establish itself on a new foundation -- because it is itself.

It follows from all this that Capitalism is in a quagmire from which it
cannot extricate itself. It shows that the destruction of its productive
forces in the war has brought it to a crisis out of which only a
revolution can come, and out of which crisis only a revolution can erect
the necessary productive power.

It is quite clear that Imperialism has put a shackle around productive
power from which it cannot free itself. Only the revolution can do this.

Certainly Capitalism will struggle to survive. It will attempt to gather
from the ruins of war the materials for building anew the Capitalist
edifice.

It will be aided in its endeavours by the Reformists, the Social
Patriots, the false Marxists. An old form of society does not go under
without a struggle.

By what method will it try to save itself?

Certainly by a method not pleasant: for the proletariat -- the
traditional, old-established way -- by the vigorous exploitation,
oppression, and enslavement of the proletariat; by the extraction of
abundant surplus wealth from their labour.

Men like Scheidemann, Legien, Henderson, Vandervelde, Thomas, Turati,
Kautsky, will aid in this.

For Capitalism there is only one way -- the way of increased
exploitation.

The new surplus wealth can have only one source -- the already
over-burdened workers. They will be urged, indeed forced, to toil harder
than ever before^[For example, through the Taylor system and other
speeding-up methods camouflaged as "welfare" systems.]. They will be
inadequately paid; the soldiers who remain in the armies will be also
underpaid, and the unemployed will starve. All will be heavily burdened
with taxation.

By what means can the Capitalists enforce their will on the workers? By
the State.

The State will compel the workers, small tradesmen, the crippled, widows
and orphans, to live in misery and poverty.

The State will maintain armed forces for the purpose of keeping the
workers in subjection -- paying one section of workers to browbeat the
others.

It will regulate production in the interests of Capitalism.

It will retain conscription.

It will take industry under its protection -- making the proletariat
State workers, industrial soldiers. It will turn them into slaves of the
companies, syndicates and trusts. The State will be a house of
correction. State Socialism will be introduced in the interests of
Capitalism, in which State Capitalism will be all-powerful, and the
workers reduced to complete slavery^[By State Socialism we understand a
system of society in which the State operates many businesses for the
Capitalists, and protects the Capitalists by laws and regulations
against the workers.].

The State will become the most relentless of exploiters; the strike will
be made impossible.

The Army will be used to enforce all this.

The same Army mobilised in 1914 to fight for Imperialism and Capitalism,
now leavened with an introduction of aristocratic and Capitalist
elements, will be used to keep the workers in subjection after the war.

During every economic or political strike this Army will be used, and
the cannon and rifles, machine guns, aeroplanes and bombs, manufactured
by the workers, will be turned on them in order to subdue them.

In short, the leaders of Capitalism will use the State and the Army to
save Capitalism, and to obtain for themselves an ever-increasing surplus
wealth, to be obtained only by the most frightful forms of oppression.

But all these horrors will compel the dispossessed and subject classes,
the workers, unemployed, demobilised soldiers, etc., to rebel.

Since Capitalism has no other means of defence but the State, then the
fight will be against the State, this being the embodiment of Capitalism
itself. The fight against Imperialism will have developed into a fight
against Capitalism itself -- a fight for the Social Revolution.

Can the proletariat accomplish what Capitalism will fail to do -- build
order out of chaos, give food and comfort to millions of workers? Can it
at one and the same time save humanity?

Most assuredly it can.

It can do this because many of the obstacles confronting Capitalism will
not be before the proletariat.

Certainly it will be a hard task to build a new order from such waste
and ruin. It will be like taking over a bankrupt business. Yet the
proletariat will do it better and more quickly than the bourgeoisie,
because it will not require to haggle or negotiate to please Capitalism.

In the first place, all the wealth and means of production to hand can
be used for the benefit of all.

It would first assume control of industry, trade, transport, banks and
agriculture. These would be controlled and regulated by a centralised
authority a development much advanced by Capitalism itself. A vast
amount of unnecessary labour would thereby be saved and labour itself
would be more equitably apportioned and unemployment thus avoided.

Kaisers, Kings, bankers, industrial magnates, junkers, landlords, etc.
-- all on whose personal account special groups of labour were ordered
will disappear, and the labour directed to productive channels.

The proletariat will not require to maintain an economic war. It will be
able to arrange, internationally, trade, transport, and exchange, in a
manner never possible to Capitalism. Labour will be organised and
centralised internationally.

The proletariat will have no interest to pay, as it will repudiate all
national debts.

The proletariat will establish instead of State Capitalism, which only
benefits the monopolists, real Socialism, which is for the benefit of
all. Owing to the fact that production and distribution will be
regulated by the proletariat, only really necessary goods will be
produced; and the duty of labour, which will be imposed upon all the
able-bodied, will result in a far greater production of all things
needful.

The proletariat will thus be able to establish a new Society better and
more speedily than is possible by the Capitalists.

We will not enumerate here the many other circumstances which will
enable the proletariat to achieve success.

The following, however, will come by degrees: -- Education; the
harmonising and unification of productive labour; the application of the
highest technical knowledge to transport, industry, and agriculture.
These are a few of the most important and necessary in the meantime.

We can now see that the material and physical conditions, the spiritual
needs and the material means; the possibility and feasibility of the
overthrow of Capitalism are here.

The greatest, incentive, the most encouraging fact for the proletariat,
is the knowledge that the whole future is for the workers; that the
workers alone can reconstruct society.

In order to confiscate the wealth and means of production, it will be
necessary for the workers to capture political power.

But people will say that the Russian Revolution has partly failed;
Germany has crushed it in many parts, and that it is in danger of being
entirely suppressed. Will not the World Revolution also be suppressed?

The answer to that is: The conditions of the Western European
Revolution, especially in England and Germany, are entirely unlike, and
cannot be compared with, those of the Russian Revolution.

In the first place the industrial workers in Russia were very few in
numbers compared with the whole population. Russia is not a
manufacturing country, but an agricultural one.

The Revolution could only be won by the Bolsheviks with the aid of the
poor peasantry. This difficulty was the greater for the Revolutionists,
because they were at the same time attacked from without.

England and Germany have a preponderance of industrial workers. The
Russian Revolution serves as an example to Western Europe. It is a
symbol, a teacher, a forerunner. It has shown the way. It has drawn up a
programme that the proletariat of Western Europe must adopt as their
own.

In the second place, we might say that the Revolutions in the Ukraine
and Finland were only partly destroyed because the Western European
workers did not rise. If they had risen, then the Socialist Soviet would
still be standing there victorious^[In the fourth chapter we will deal
more extensively with the difference between the Russian and the Western
European Revolutions.].

But the Western workers will revolt during or after the war, and with
the help of the Russian proletariat will achieve complete victory. But
it may be objected that real revolutionaries amongst the Western
proletariat are very few in number, and therefore will not be able to
win. Again, let us turn to Russia. The Maximalists there during the war
and before the Revolution were in a minority. Famine conditions
converted them into a majority. The same causes will operate to bring"
about the same result in other countries.

It may be said that though the proletariat are more numerous in Western
Europe than any other single class, yet they do not exceed in numbers
all the other classes put together. In Germany the number of industrial
workers is estimated at 15 millions. In England their number, in
proportion to the population, is much greater. To this must be added the
farm labourers, who will throw in their lot with the revolutionary
proletariat, as we shall show. Their organisations, both political and
industrial, are powerful. In England they number have millions. In
Germany between three millions and four millions are organised. In other
countries like conditions prevail. In all of them a large number of the
population will act with and support the revolutionaries in the coming
struggle. They need only to be exposed to the rays of the sun of
revolution to have their latent strength quickened and made manifest in
all its grandeur.

The fight is now between "big business" and the proletariat. The issue
is, who shall receive the surplus wealth, the Capitalists or the
workers? Either the Capitalists will continue to appropriate it by the
oppression of State Socialism, or the proletariat will take it by
setting up real Socialism.

How the struggle will end depends largely upon what attitude is taken by
the middle class, especially the lower middle class; which in England
and Germany is the most numerous.

The Capitalists will be forced to tax themselves. But the debts and
requirements of the States are so great that in order to provide for
these, and maintain and increase their power, they will be compelled to
oppress all other classes, including the middle class. In addition to
exploiting the working class, they will lay the heaviest possible
burdens upon the middle class, shopkeepers and farmers. They will keep
down the salaries of their officials and employees. All this, combined
with famine, scarcity of raw materials, and of work, and high prices
will drive the middle class to the side of the workers.

That part of surplus wealth that went to the middle class was always
small. After the war and under Imperialism it will be smaller still. To
this class, or at least to the lower portion of it, a Socialist society
offers more than the Capitalist State. Real Socialism would be better
for them than State Socialism.

The patient, persistent propaganda of the last thirty years has done its
work. Millions in Western Europe now know what Socialism means. They
will realise ere long that now is the time to decide. There is only one
choice possible: Imperialistic Capitalism or Socialism. The question to
be decided is: Which shall be dictator of the world -- Capital or
Labour, Imperialism or Socialism?

The terrible plight into which Imperialism has brought the world has
made possible the international unity of the workers, and the adhesion
to their ranks of the lower middle classes.

And so there rises before us the possibility of almost immediately
realising Socialism. Shall the workers conquer the world? Shall they
unite humanity in one great whole? Shall the human race be freed once
and for all from the shackles of Capitalism and Imperialism? It depends
upon the workers themselves -- upon whether they are sufficiently brave,
sufficiently educated, and sufficiently united.

There is one danger to be guarded against -- the danger of disunity. The
Imperialists of the victorious belligerent group will unite with those
of the defeated nations, and with the reformists and social-patriots,
against the proletariat. There will thus be formed one front: on one
side the Capitalist classes, reformists and chauvinists; on the other
the revolutionaries. If a national proletariat prefers one Imperialism
to another; if it allows itself to be bribed by its national rulers, or
to be deceived by treacherous Labour leaders; if it accepts the State
Socialism of its national Capitalists; if the international proletariat
remains divided, one section betraying and deserting the others; if one
part after another is allowed to be smashed by international Imperialism
-- then the success of the Revolution will be impossible, and we shall
have to endure a new era of Capitalism, Imperialism, and Militarism.

But even if defeated at the first attempt, international unity, even if
it takes years to accomplish, must be established. It should, in any
case, be the result of this first world war.

In the beginning of the great struggle for Socialism, the proletariat of
each country will, of course, fight against its own national Capitalism;
but as the struggle progresses, the necessary international unity will
be established. There will be set up an International like a Trade Union
or a federation of Trade Unions, in which the members will be pledged to
support and defend one another. As in a Trade Union when a member acts
as a blackleg, or as in a federation when one of the affiliated bodies
fails to strike in sympathy with the others, so in the new
International, when the proletariat of a nation does not play its part
in the emancipation of humanity, it will be considered a national scab.

We shall now endeavour to sketch the programme which such an
International should endeavour to carry out.

### International Programme of the Revolutionaries.

1. Political power to be in the hands of the proletariat.
2. Legislation by the proletariat.
3. A minimum standard of living for all workers. All workers to be
   equal.
4. Control and regulation of all production and distribution by the
   proletariat.
5. Work to be obligatory on all.
6. Repudiation of National Debts.
7. Confiscation of war profits.
8. Taxes to be levied only on capital and income: that on the former to
   be increased till it becomes expropriation.
9. Confiscation of banks.
10. Confiscation of large businesses.
11. Confiscation of the land.
12. Judicial power to be wielded by the proletariat.
13. Abolition of all tolls and tariffs.
14. Present military systems to be abolished and the proletariat to be
    armed.

### Explanation of Programme.

The first item gives the proletariat the means to destroy the old
Capitalist State by destroying its instruments of power -- bureaucracy,
police, and army.

The second gives it the power to lay the foundations of, and build up,
the new society. These means and powers must be given only to the
proletariat, because it is the only class that is capable of realising
Socialism. But, of course, it may allow other sections of the population
to share in these privileges, if it considers them true to the
Revolution.

The third assures to the workers a sound basis of existence through the
equitable allocation of food, housing, etc. This must also be guaranteed
to the small shopkeepers, poor farmers, disabled soldiers and sailors,
widows and orphans, and all who have not sufficient means of
subsistence. In short, help immediately, and complete liberation in the
future, should be promised to all who are oppressed.

The fourth point, together with the fifth -- work for all -- is the only
means whereby a Socialist society can be constructed from the ruins of
the old one.

Clauses 6 to 9 provide the means for carrying out the third, and so
consolidating the foundations of the new order.

It will be understood, of course, that in taxing capital and income, a
minimum will be fixed, below which no tax will be imposed.

The tenth point -- confiscation of large businesses, -- covers iron and
steel works, coal mines, foreign trade, railways, shipping, etc.

It is not contrary to the fourth point; for in that it is control and
regulation of all production that is insisted upon. The confiscation of
small businesses cannot be carried out right away on account of their
great number.

So far as agriculture is concerned, the land will be confiscated and the
principle of common ownership established; but in the case of the
smaller holders this can only be done by degrees. At first only the
large agricultural concerns ought to be taken over and worked by the
community itself, or co-operatively by the small farmers and the
labourers.

The line dividing great and small concerns would be different in
different countries, provinces, and businesses. There will be, in each
case, different means and methods of confiscation.

The wealthy landowner and the rich farmer can be dealt with by taxation.
The moderately wealthy farmer will be hit sufficiently by the
confiscation of the land banks. The community, and not a landlord, will
receive rent from the farmer.

There is nothing in these proposals that cannot be carried out. On the
other hand, if mooted and not carried into execution, they would drive
the farming class into counter-revolution. By these measures, in
conjunction with the third point of the programme, the small farmers and
farm labourers can be won over to the Revolution, and the middle class
farmers can be induced to become, if not friends, at least not enemies.

The agricultural question is one of great difficulty. The measures
indicated above, coupled with the development of productive power,
provide the only possible settlement.

The twelfth point -- the vesting of judicial authority in the
proletariat -- gives to that class alone the power in the Socialist
Republic by which it can defend the new society from attack.

The last paragraph but one -- the abolition of all tolls and tariffs --
has for its object the removal of one of the greatest causes of enmity
between peoples, and of one of the most serious obstacles to the
international regulation of production and distribution.

The last demand is the crowning part of the programme. It overthrows
Capitalistic militarism, and puts an end to Capitalistic wars. The
second part of it -- the arming of the proletariat -- puts into the
hands of the workers the means whereby they can defend the Revolution
from enemies both within and without, and establish the dictatorship of
the proletariat.

It is absolutely necessary that revolutionary international Social
Democrats should get their programme ready as soon as possible -- in
fact, at once! If the revolution does not take place in the principal
countries at the same time and with the same intention; if a succession
of unorganised revolts takes place -- failure will be the inevitable
result, and the revolution will be smothered in blood.

The example of the Russian Maximalists shows us clearly the advantages a
clear-cut and well-defined programme gives when it is ready and
published beforehand. It shows also what happens when the people of
other nations do not revolt at the same time and with the same
programme.

The programme should be a revolutionary one, but should contain only
those demands which the Revolution can make possible of fulfilment. It
ought to be as simple as possible, so that every worker may understand
what the Revolution aims at. It should be of such a nature that all
Socialists can endorse it. Therefore it should not contain any
legislative details which might cause conflict between nations with
different lines of development.

Lastly, it is essential that it should unite only **real
revolutionaries**. It should, by its provisions, debar all who are not
prepared to fight for the Revolution.

The programme outlined above would ensure all that.

There is still one other remark to make which is of the greatest
importance to the workers. They would do well to remember that after the
war the strike -- even the general strike -- cannot win them everything;
because there will be shortage of capital, shortage of raw material and
of machinery, and little demand for labour.

As soon as the workers are disarmed, the ruling classes will begin to
bind and gag them. This, coupled with unemployment and hunger, and the
sufferings that follow in their train, may goad the people into revolt.
In such an event the ruling classes will have, under arms and ready for
action, troops selected from the anti-revolutionary sections of the
population, and the proletariat will be dragooned into submission.

If, on the other hand, the proletariat, before demobilisation takes
place, puts forward these proposals or a similar general programme, the
ruling caste, fearing the power of the workers and the other classes
which would support them, will give way, and their demands will be
conceded without bloodshed.

Therefore we insist on the necessity for getting the programme ready
immediately. The one sketched above is offered merely as an example. It
would be well if the revolutionaries of all countries would set about
the work at once.

The necessity and the possibility of the Revolution in West Europe --
which is a condition of the World Revolution -- can be clearly seen. A
proletariat strong in its organisations and great in its numbers is
here. A society ripe for Socialism, which has already taken its first
step into State Socialism, is here. And the way to the new society, now
at last visible to the workers, lies through a revolutionary programme.

Has the proletariat the physical and moral strength to overthrow
Capitalism in all countries and to conquer Imperialism?

It will have the power when it is united.

Will the workers be able to achieve unity?

In order that they may benefit by the example of the Russian proletariat
in its struggle for unity and victory, we shall deal in the next chapter
with the Russian Revolution.

## Chapter 4: The Example of the Russian Revolution

The Russian Revolution is, for the European and American workers, who
have it still before them, a splendid and clear example. This example is
itself the result of the development of Imperialism, from which the West
European workers can learn how they have to act, how they can attain
unity and win the victory.

We will deal with the Russian Revolution in order that the proletariat
may see how far it can follow the same path, and where it must take its
own course^[The Russian Revolution is the first revolution to be
undertaken by Marxists, and in accordance with the Marxican [sic]
theory. The teachings of the Anarchist, the syndicalist, the Reformist,
and the pseudo-Marxist (e.g., Kautsky), were proved in the Revolution to
be useless.].

The Russian industrial proletariat is very small in proportion to the
whole population of the gigantic Empire.

The great mass of the Russian population are peasants, and among these a
very great number are small farmers or farm labourers. The poor
peasantry form the majority of the peasant population.

The old Czarism was supported by the great land-owners, a powerful body
in Russia, and also by the capital of the big industries, which was,
however, a weak prop when one considers the extent of the Empire.
Czarism found it could not bear the burden of the great war; and when it
became apparent that the industries and transport were not equal to the
task they were called upon to perform and famine ensued, it was
overthrown by the combined efforts of the upper and lower bourgeoisie,
the middle class peasants, the poor peasants, and the proletariat. These
classes then attempted, with Russia as a bourgeois republic, to carry on
the war.

The peasants' party, the Social-Revolutionists, the reformists and the
social-patriots (Mensheviks), all worked hand in hand.

The small party of real revolutionaries (the Bolsheviks) opposed them.
It was led by the man who had always stood firm for revolution -- the
revolution for Socialism and against any momentary success; and has
thereby proved himself to be the ablest politician the world-proletariat
has had since Marx. This man was Lenin.

As the Russian proletariat is the advance guard of the
world-proletariat, so Lenin is the champion of this advance guard.

Only later generations who will know all his wor[?] and deeds, and who
will be free from passion and prejudice will be able to compare him with
his contemporaries, and pass true judgment upon him. But I am convinced
that he surpasses all other leaders of the proletariat, and that he
alone deserves to be placed side by side with Marx. Marx surpasses him
in theoretical knowledge and dialectical acuteness, he towers above Marx
by his deeds.

His tactics, before, during, and after the Revolution are far beyond
anything that the proletariat had previously accomplished in the sphere
of politics.

And we are drawn towards him as we were towards Marx. And the mind and
the soul of the man inspire us with affection. His simplicity, his
sincerity, his courage, the truth of his very being -- these are the
causes of our affection. He is the leader of the Russian Revolution. May
he be the leader of the World Revolution!

The Bolsheviks said that the workers of Russia should not start the
bourgeois revolution with the bourgeoisie, the landed proprietors and
the rich farmers, but should begin a proletarian revolution with the
help of the poor peasants.

They drew up a programme for the social revolution of which the chief
points were: All power to the worker, the land for the poor peasants,
and peace.

The Capitalists, the landed proprietors, the rich peasants, and the
reformists, carried on the war till Russia was again nearing the abyss.
None of the demands of the workers and poor peasants was conceded.

Then the poor peasantry and the whole of the proletariat drifted away
from the reformists and social-patriots and became united under the
Bolshevik banner. The Bolsheviks were able to overthrow the Government
and seize political power. And they used this power to lay the
foundation for Socialism.

The same thing will have to be done by the Western European and American
workers.

They must either immediately overthrow their Capitalistic Government,
whether it be monarchy or democracy; they must first deal with the
bourgeois Government and then with the Government made up of elements
taken from bourgeoisie and social-patriotic and reformist groups.

The Russian revolutionaries -- the workers and the small farmers --
captured political power. And they took that over solely for their own
ends.

They gave the right to vote and the right to be elected only to
proletarians and poor peasants.

They divided Russia into districts, whose Workers' Councils (Soviets)
elected the District Workers' Councils. These District Workers' Councils
elected the Central Council [of?] the Empire, and the congress of the
Councils elected the Executive Committee.

All members of the Local, District, and Central Councils, and also all
officials and employees, are elected for a short period only, and are
always liable to be called to account for their actions^[This is to
prevent the formation of a new bureaucracy, or a new independent power,
being raised above the workers.].

As in general all officials have a low salary, and as all the Councils
have to meet regularly and often, there will be formed a flexible body
as the first Socialist Government in the world.

The light of the new world radiates from these Councils.

The working class of the world has found in these Workers' Councils its
organisation and its centralisation, its form and its expression, for
the revolution and for the socialist society.

What Marx had foretold -- that the working class could not simply take
over the Government machinery of the Capitalistic State, but that it
must find its own forms -- actually [?] come to pass. The organisation
and the centralisation, the form and the expression of the proletarian
revolution, the foundation of the socialist society, are here.

The Russian revolutionaries in these institutions have given an example
to the workers of the world.

With this example before its eyes the world-proletariat can now make the
world revolution.

The world-proletariat must erect Workers' Councils -- councils of the
locality, of the provinces or districts, of the empires or nations, as a
means to the revolution, and as, the new form of its society. These
Councils alone shall have power.

Workers' Councils of the nations, of the peoples, in place of
Capitalistic Governments: that is the form of the revolution and of the
new society which the workers must everywhere create.

The Russian revolutionaries gave power only to the workers, and to the
poor peasants who are on a par with the workers.

They gave the land to the poor peasants.

They made peace whilst Capitalists and Capitalism slaughtered humanity
and destroyed the earth.

They took over all the great industries, the banks, and the means of
transport.

They repudiated the National Debt.

They confiscated all property.

They introduced compulsory labour.

For the first time since modern Capitalism came into being, the worker,
the producer of capital, became its owner. The working class came into
possession of its products: the means of production. The whole capital
came into the hands of those who produced it, and who were its sole
legitimate owners. It left the hands of those who expropriated it, and
went back into the hands of the real owners, the people who created it.

The Russian revolutionaries introduced a uniform standard of education
with free instruction for everyone. They threw open to everyone all the
higher educational institutions.

They introduced control of the factories and workshops by the workers.

They brought the industries under the control of the community of
workers.

They began to exploit the great industries as communal industries.

They allowed cooperative societies of poor peasants to exploit the large
estates.

They made a start with systematic barter, a systematic transport, and a
systematic production.

They began to make the whole social progress of production into a great
systematic entity. They did the same with distribution.

Throughout the whole of Russia, communistic industries are now springing
up.

All banking institutions are in the possession of the Soviets.

A number of industrial and transport undertakings are in the possession
of, and are controlled by, the Socialist community.

A number of agricultural industries are run for the Socialist community
through Socialist and Communist peasants, among whom the land has been
apportioned.

A beginning has been made with Socialist exchange and Socialist trade.
In short, the Socialist society has been founded.

And is it possible that what the Russian workers can do and have done,
can not be done by the English and German workers?

The latter will be able to do it much better.

They will be better able to take over the banks, and the means of
production and distribution.

They will be better able to establish the Socialist society. And then
will follow suit the proletariat of all Europe and North America -- of
the whole world. In their case the great industries are far more
powerful and more numerous. Besides, they have the organisation which
will enable them to take over the means of life.

They have the power, the experience.

They have the intellectual strength.

They have a net of unions, in all branches of industry, over the whole
land.

The Workers' Unions in Russia rejoice over the beginning of Socialism,
over Socialist work, which is not done for private Capitalism and
masters, but for the community and for equals.

The intellectuals, who in the beginning with the possessing classes
resorted to sabotage, have now in great numbers taken up Socialist work.

Socialist labour conditions are developing. Of course it is with
difficulty, but they are developing.

And with and through these conditions the Socialist mind, the Socialist
spirit, has come. The Communist character has appeared. Through
Socialist work the Communist emotion is engendered: Communist joy,
Communist desire, Communist happiness, the Communist heart.

There is no longer any doubt that in a short time the spiritual
expression, the new and higher knowledge, and the new and higher art,
will burst forth out of this bud, out of this first beginning of the
Commune.

Contrary to expectations a Socialist society was born from the blood of
the Russian workers, and it now stands before us like a beautiful
flower.

Through the struggles of the Russian workers and poor peasants there
appears for the proletariat, and indeed for all exploited people, the
dawn of a new era.

The Bolsheviks are holding aloft a torch which illuminates the whole of
nature and society. They give to the world-proletariat, in advance, in
their own methods and deeds, a picture of those that must be adopted and
emulated in order to attain success.

The unexpected has happened. In the infinite riches of nature and
society there lay something whose existence was undreamt of. Neither
England nor Germany made the beginning in Socialism. That honour belongs
to Russia. Through a remarkable combination of circumstances and
conditions the opportunity came to set up Communism; and there it stands
to-day.

Communist society should soon spread over the whole of Russia. In the
hands of the workers it should soon grow to perfection. If not, then
Socialism is only possible internationally.

The Bolsheviks realise that, and have therefore done everything in their
power to set in motion the proletariat of all other lands in the
direction of Socialism. They know that their own revolution runs the
greatest danger of being defeated; and still the revolution in Europe
and North America hangs fire. The different economic and political
conditions in those parts of the world delay the advent of the world
revolution.

But that does not prevent the Bolsheviks from carrying on their glorious
work. They realise that the triumph of the revolution in Russia would
act as a guiding star to the proletariat of the world. They realise that
it is necessary to set an example to the workers of other countries.
They are determined to hold fast to Socialism in spite of all
opposition. The workers of the world would be compelled to recognise
that Socialism had come out of the great war that had apparently
destroyed it.

When Germany made peace with the Bolsheviks it was a peace in appearance
only. In; reality it was intended to destroy them. Just as the
Bolsheviks expected, the Germans stole the Ukraine, the granary of
Russia where the Soviets were in power. They took Poland, Lithuania,
Livonia, Esthonia, Finland, and the Caucasus, and made preparations to
annex other parts of Russia.

The Bolsheviks submitted to this in order to save the Socialist society.
They withdrew into the interior of the country, and did all they could
to develop and extend the new form of society. They knew that only in
this way could they keep in touch with, and remain united to, the German
and English-American proletariat. Their sacrifice of a part of their
country so that they might continue the struggle against Imperialism and
maintain their solidarity with the workers of other lands, was the first
example of international unity amongst the workers.

History does not furnish a greater or more sublime act than this --
great in its comprehensiveness, sublime in its meaning, for the workers
and for the whole of humanity.

The arrival of Socialism has been proclaimed by a herald worthy of its
name.

There is no reason why the revolution could not have succeeded, or why
the Socialist society could not have been gradually built up, if there
had been no intervention by other nations, although the establishment of
Socialism in a country that is mainly agricultural is contrary to
orthodox Socialist Science. The orthodox view is that only in a
highly-developed industrial country is it possible to achieve Socialism.
But the developments of nature and of society are not all comprehended
by science. They are always bringing to light something new. In Russia
there were exceptional classes and class conditions. There was a fairly
numerous, very revolutionary proletariat, a large number of whom are,
like the peasants, in great poverty. These classes were stronger than
all the others. There was a degenerate class of bureaucrats and
landowners, and a weak Capitalist class. Why, then, could not the first
two classes together establish a Socialist society? Why could they not
Socialise by degrees, banks, industry, trade, etc.? They had the power.
They were armed. Under these conditions who could prevent them?

They would encounter, of course, great opposition from the possessing
classes, the richer farmers, the nobles, the Capitalists, and a part of
the middle class -- even from some of the poor peasants themselves who
still cling to individualist ideas. But these difficulties are not
insurmountable.

Time and patience only are required.

The attempt will, at all events, be made.

In order to give them a fair chance of success it is necessary that no
outside power should attack them, and rob them of their food, and assist
and strengthen the counter-revolution.

Workers of the world! It was, is, and will be, impossible to maintain
Socialism in any country if it is attacked by all other countries. It
must be set up in several -- in all of the advanced countries, at least
-- at the same time.

That is the first lesson we are taught by the Russian Revolution.

Now the great drama proceeds. Germany tears the body of Russia to
pieces, and by cutting off the Ukraine causes hunger and scarcity.
Prices rise. The speculation in foodstuffs assumes gigantic dimensions.
Some of the farmers, dissatisfied with the prices for their produce
fixed by the community, desert the workers. Hunger and want bring the
work of reform to a standstill -- especially the division of the land
and the communisation of agriculture. Some of the farmers and the Social
Revolutionaries break away from the Bolsheviks and try to persuade
Russia to re-enter the war against Germany that has caused so much
misery, and by that means overthrow the Revolution. At the same time
England, France, Japan, and the United States force their way into
Russia and endeavour to seize large slices of territory in Siberia and
on the Murman coast. They supply the counter-revolutionaries with arms
and money, and assist them in any other way they can. On all sides
enemies of the Revolution raise their heads, but they have no chance of
winning except by foreign assistance.

Attacked on all sides by the minions of Capitalism, the kernel of the
Socialist Brotherhood struggles for existence -- endeavouring to
develop, or at least to live, and awaits the European Revolution. But,
as already stated, the American, the world revolution, is not coming to
its assistance; and meanwhile the Russian Revolution itself stands in
the greatest danger. The world revolution will come, but later, owing to
different historical, economic and political conditions that exist in
other parts of the world.

We shall now indicate what these conditions are, so that the proletariat
may see why the world revolution can come only after the Russian
Revolution.

The first great difference between the Russian and West European
Revolutions is this. The Russian revolutionaries could only carry
through the Revolution with the help of the peasants. The peasants
themselves were revolutionary. Without their help the workers could have
done but little, even with the most reckless courage. In Russia there
were a great number of large estates. These belonged to the Royal
Family, the State, the nobles, and the Church. These estates could be
divided. The peasant wanted the land. The revolutionary workers wanted
them to have it. The peasants therefore joined forces with the workers.

Herein lies the great difference between Russia and Western Europe. In
the West, even in, England and Germany, there are not many propertiless
farmers or peasants; and except in a few countries and districts there
are not many large estates. On the contrary, in many European countries
-- Germany, France, Scandinavia, Holland, Belgium -- middle-sized and
small estates are the general rule. The workers in Western Europe must
make the Revolution without the peasants, or in comparison with Russia,
with only a small number. There the proletariat had strong support; here
they stand alone. That is the first reason why the Revolution here will
come later.

The second reason is: The Government and the bureaucracy were weak; in
Europe, and especially in England and Germany, they are very strong. In
Russia the organisation of Capitalism was very detective; here
(especially again in England and Germany) Capitalism is splendidly
organised. In Russia the opponents of the revolutionaries were weak;
those of the West European revolutionaries are strong. The Russian
proletariat stood with a strong auxiliary behind them and a weak
Capitalism in front. In the West the proletariat stand alone in
opposition to a powerful Capitalism.

The workers in Western Europe are, in comparison with the rest of the
population, more numerous than in Russia, but not so numerous as workers
and peasants combined.

In the West the workers have a firm foundation on which to build
Socialism. Firstly, the banking system, the principal branches of
industry, transport and trade, were, even before the war, ripe for
socialisation. Secondly, Imperialism has during the war centralised
production and distribution. This organisation is technically powerful
and can be taken over by the proletariat as a basis on which to rear the
Socialist society. In Russia these organisations either do not exist or
are very imperfect.

In Russia society was technically unripe for Socialism before the war,
and its organisation has been greatly weakened during the period of the
war. In Western Europe society was ripe for the change before the war;
and during the war its organisation and centralisation have been greatly
strengthened.

In Russia a small proletariat, helped by a great revolutionary
peasantry, stand before the task of building up a new society with
limited economic means at their disposal. The proletariat of Western
Europe stand before their task alone, but they are powerful and well
organised, and possess great economic resources.

The Russian proletariat, small in numbers but assisted by the peasantry,
struggle with slender means against weak opponents. The workers of
Western Europe great in numbers, but quite alone, fight with great
resources against powerful opponents. The organisation of the Western
workers has been thrown into confusion during the war through the
separation of its members. The organisation of capital, and especially
of the Governments, has been greatly strengthened in the same period.
Through these causes the Revolution will come later, and will be more
difficult in Western Europe than in Russia. It will be entirely
different from the Russian Revolution.

The peasants of the West are not revolutionary as those of Russia are.
This is true of the great majority of the small farmers and of the
shopkeepers as well.

Although the proletarians stand alone now, if they adopt the right
tactics they will not stand alone when the crisis comes. Because the
material foundations of Socialism are here they can reckon on the help
of others in the Revolution. With the right tactics and the right
programme they will attract millions of adherents. A real proletarian
programme aiming at the establishment of complete Socialism will make
adherents and allies of all the lower working classes, the small
business people, the lesser Government officials and employees, and the
small farmers.

Although these classes are not revolutionary of themselves they will
certainly ally themselves with the proletariat, for they have been hard
hit by the war and oppressed by Imperialism. The small Capitalists have
long been hesitating between the Capitalist and Socialist parties. Up to
the present the greater number of them have adhered to the Capitalist
parties. But as a result of the war they can be won over to Socialism if
the right policy is pursued. The proletariat will then have a majority.

The war has pressed so heavily upon these classes that if they can only
be made to realise that their only choice is between Imperialism and
Socialism, they will choose the latter. When the alternative is
presented to them of being despoiled by Capitalist Imperialism through
high prices, taxes and war, or being saved by Socialism, they will plump
for Socialism.

Let the proletariat say to all the working classes: Imperialism and war
destroy you. We assure you an existence whether you have work to do or
not. You shall not lack the necessaries of life.

Let them say to the small Capitalists and Government minor officials and
employees: Imperialism breaks you by its wars, its taxes, low wages,
hunger and poverty. Socialism, which will take all wealth and all big
businesses and put them in the hands of the community; which will
centralise production and distribution over the whole world -- offers to
you low taxes, and later no taxes at all. It assures you regular work
and an honourable position. It gives you, in common with all other
citizens, peace, happiness, and comfort.

To the small shopkeepers let them say: Remain in your places. You shall
have wares to sell. We have all the large businesses in our hands. We
will supply you with wares and raw material. By degrees your businesses
will become part of our system, and you will ultimately, like all other
citizens, be employed in the production or distribution of goods for the
community.

To the small farmers and to a part of the well-to-do farmers let the
proletariat say: Imperialism and Capitalism break you through war,
taxes, and high rents. They take away your sons. They deprive you of
your cattle. They will continue to do after the war. The Socialist
society, on the other hand, will allow you to carry on your work in
peace. It will relieve you, wholly or partly, from taxes. It will free
you from your landlords, and in many other ways reduce your burdens. As
for the large estates, it will apportion them amongst you to be worked
on a Communistic basis for the benefit of the whole community. As so on
as the development of productive forces makes it feasible, it will
convert all your businesses into a co-operative Communist concern, in
which all workers will be equally great and powerful in, a free society
of workers.

And finally, to all these classes let the proletariat: say: We can do
all this if you help us. In that event we shall have in our hands
control of all the great industries of wealth production and
distribution. We shall have all the capital and all the riches of
society at our command.

There can be no doubt that those classes who are so much oppressed by
Imperialism will accept this offer. The increasing pressure to which
they are being subjected will make them range themselves on the side of
the proletariat. In England, if it is set about in the right way, it can
quite easily be done.

Here is seen again the great difference between Russia and Western
Europe. In the former the proletariat could not make such an offer,
because Russia was weak in productive forces and poor in capital. In the
latter there are enormous masses of capital and gigantic productive
power, and a complete organisation of both. With such conditions it is
easy to supplant Imperialistic Capitalism with its inevitable results,
death and destruction, by Socialism, and in consequence, comfort,
equality, and peace. The intelligent members of the "lower" classes, who
have no direct interest in Capitalism, will be won over to the side of
the revolutionaries.

We may well take a lesson in this matter from the Bolsheviks. How did
they obtain the help of the peasants? They put forward a programme which
demanded "All power to the workers," "the land for the peasants," and
"Peace."

No other party had a like programme. The Social-Revolutionaries (in
their first phase) and the Mensheviks (the reformers) betrayed the
people and the peasants by alliances with the landowners and
Capitalists.

If the Western proletariat make any compromise with the Capitalists, or
ally themselves with them in any way, they will receive no support from
the shopkeepers, Government officials or employees. These people are too
intelligent not to see that in that case the proletariat would be
powerless to free them from Imperialism.

There is no middle course. The toilers must do as they did in Russia --
demand all power to the workers, confiscate all wealth and industries,
concentrate production and distribution in their own hands. They must,
in short, establish Socialism.

The Russian Revolution teaches us another lesson. The Bolsheviks won not
only by the help of the poor peasants, but also, in the first instance
by the absolute unity of all the working class. If they had not had that
unity they could not have induced the other classes to join them.

The working classes in Western Europe are threatened with a great danger
-- a danger which has grown greater during the last twenty-five years.
It comes from the reformists and social-patriots. Just as they held the
proletariat back from revolution, and effected an alliance with the
bourgeoisie and brought them into the war, so they will endeavour with
the help of the bourgeoisie to bring the proletariat of the world into
State Socialism.

The Capitalists, in order to escape the danger of bankruptcy through
disorganisation of production and National Debts, will be forced after
the war to nationalise many undertakings, or to put them under State
control. They will then take away the right to strike, reduce wages,
increase he [sic] working hours, and speed up work to the highest
possible pitch. In short, the workers will be State slaves.

The programme of the German, English, Italian, and French reformists,
shows quite clearly that they will assist the Capitalists to do this.
Their assistance will be given on condition that one part of the workers
-- the members of the great Trade Unions -- get advantages over, and
preferences greater than, the others -- such as higher wages, better
conditions of labour, etc.

The Capitalists would willingly buy at this price the social-patriots
and a part of the proletariat.

In England the danger is threatened by the Labour Party and the Trade
Unions; in Germany by the Majority and the Independents, the Trade
Unions and the Social-Democrats; in France by the Majority and Centre
Parties and the workers' syndicates; and in America by the Trade Unions.
Everywhere the danger appears.

If this plot succeeds, the division of the workers will be effected.
Some will go over to Imperialism; others will declare for the
Revolution. Then will the Revolution be lost, for the working class will
be powerless. It will be impotent in itself, and will receive no support
from other sections of the population -- shopkeepers, small farmers,
etc. It will be at the mercy of Imperialism.

Only when the proletariat is absolutely united, and no section of it
agrees to State Socialism, will it have the power to win.

We repeat again, the perfect unity of the proletariat is the second
lesson of the Russian Revolution.

There is still another lesson the Russian example affords to the Western
proletariat. The Russian workers are partly defeated already because the
German, English, and American proletariat did not make a revolution at
the same time.

The Russian revolutionaries are in constant danger of defeat. If they
are finally crushed we know the reason why.

Attacked by all the powers of Capitalism, by all the forces of the
world, the Russian proletariat will hold fast to the Revolution to the
last, and dying will give another and greater example to the proletariat
of the world.

Holding fast to the World Revolution, suffering for it, dying for it:
this is internationalism, indeed. This solidarity of the workers of
Russia with the workers of the world: this is the last and greatest
lesson the Russian Revolution teaches to the world proletariat.

In the middle of the Capitalist orgy of blood appeared the unity of the
proletariat. In the midst of the world war appeared the kernel of a new
humanity.

The Russian Revolution, through its decision, its foresight and its
courage, through its form of organisation (the Soviets) and through its
deeds (through its deeds more than anything else), its overthrow of
Czardom and Capitalism; the confiscation of capital, the initiation of
the organisation of Socialism, its union of the poor peasants with the
other workers, its fidelity to international unity -- is a splendid
example to Western Europe, to America, and the whole world.

There can be no doubt that the workers of the world, with this brilliant
example before them, will begin at once to unite.

The struggle to establish Socialism all over the world will then begin
in earnest.

## Chapter 5: Summing up

### I.

The World Revolution is necessary.

The Imperialisms of all nations are alike inimical to the workers.

Therefore the international proletariat must unite and destroy World
Revolution [read Imperialism].

But Imperialism cannot be destroyed unless Capitalism is destroyed.

Therefore the Revolution for the destruction of Capitalism and the
establishment of Socialism is necessary now.

### II.

There is no way out of Imperialism for Capitalism.

There is no salvation for the proletariat through Imperialism.

Imperialist Capitalism has divided the nations of the world into two
groups to fight for the mastery of the earth.

Three powerful nations -- Germany, England, and the United States --
have the leadership of these two groups.

There is no hope of a peaceful settlement of this struggle, for all
three nations, and all the countries allied with them, want world power
for one of themselves, or for the group to which they belong.

There is no means of deciding the issue but war.

The bourgeoisie, the reformists, and the social-patriots seek a
settlement, but their solutions have no real value, and serve only to
blind the workers and keep them in subjection. A Court of Compulsory
Arbitration, a League of Nations, Disarmament, the Right of
Self-Determination for all nationalities, Democracy -- neither these nor
any of the other petty little proposals put for ward by these groups can
extricate Capitalism from the contradictions into which it has fallen.
From the mass of surplus wealth which it heaps up; from the desire for
expansion which is the result of this accumulation; from the conquest of
foreign markets which it must make; from the wars that must result; from
the self-destruction that will follow from that warfare: from these
there is no escape for Capitalism.

The proletariat will not be able to bear the strain of the struggle.
They will be forced to revolt in order to escape from the slaughter and
oppression.

And they can only escape Imperialism by destroying Capitalism.

Their revolt, then, is the necessary Revolution against World
Capitalism, the Social-Revolution of the World-Proletariat, the World
Revolution.

### III.

This Revolution is possible and feasible.

It is so from the following reasons: --

Capitalism is ripe for Socialism.

The war has laid the foundations for Socialism.

Capitalism itself must go over to Socialism -- State Socialism, of
course.

The proletariat is moving in the same direction with natural evolution.

The material and moral results of the war are so disastrous for the
proletariat that it must come to revolution.

The destruction of productive power, the pain, the hate, the hunger, the
never-ending slaughter, will drive the proletariat to revolution during
or after the war.

The proletariat is so strong in its organisation that it is quite able
to carry through the Revolution.

The following programme could, we think, be accepted by the
international proletariat.

Political power to be in the hands of the proletariat.

Legislation by the proletariat.

The guarantee of a decent standard of living to all workers. All workers
to be equal.

Control and regulation of all production and distribution by the
proletariat.

Compulsory work for all.

Repudiation of the National Debts.

Confiscation of war profits.

Only capital and income to be taxed: the tax on the former rising till
it amounts to confiscation.

Confiscation of banks.

Confiscation of all large businesses.

Confiscation of the land.

Judicial rights to be vested in the proletariat.

Abolition of all tolls and tariffs.

Abolition of present military systems. Arming of the proletariat.

On this programme the international proletariat can unite and win.

On this programme it would win.

### IV.

The workers of the world have a brilliant example to guide them. That
example is the Russian Revolution. It has shown that only two things are
necessary for success: unity of the workers, national and international;
and simultaneous revolt.

If the workers of a country are net united they will be defeated by the
international bourgeoisie.

If the proletariat does not go in for the complete overthrow of the
Capitalist system it cannot free itself nor any other exploited class,
and will not get the support from those others it would otherwise
receive.

But the Russian Revolution has done something more.

It has discovered the form by which the proletariat can achieve victory:
Workers' Councils (Soviets). These it has set up in every village and
every province in the country.

These Councils have all economic and political power.

The Workers' Councils, which will destroy Capitalism and establish
Socialism; which will expropriate Capitalism and transfer all power and
wealth to Socialism; which will build up Socialism politically and
economically: these Councils are the form and expression of the New
Society, of the New Humanity.

At present they embrace only the struggling, the victorious proletariat;
but in the coming time they will comprise the entire human race.

The Councils of Labour -- of Labour and nothing but Labour -- will, in
the days to come, be the highest and holiest corporation of humanity.

Unity of the national proletariat; unity of the international
proletariat; the uniting and organising of the proletariat into Workers'
Councils -- these are the three great things the Russian Revolution has
taught the workers of the world.

If the West European, the North American, the world-proletariat, were
united; if they would establish the new International; if they would all
revolt at the same time; if they would organise themselves in Workers'
Councils and take over all economic and political power -- then would
the World Revolution be accomplished.

Already we see in the not distant future the New International, the
great Workers' Council of all the nations of the earth.

Already we see the International Workers' Council, the forerunner of the
new, free, Communist Humanity.

THE END.

[^note-2]: This problem is a most serious one, and it is fraught with
    great danger. The national proletariat who are led by the Reformists
    trust the Liberals and Democrats, and the international proletariat
    trust the Imperialism of the Great citizen democracies.

	And so long as this trust continues, so long as the French, English, American, Belgian, etc., workers believe that the English-American Imperialism is one whit better than the German; so long will there be no unity of the proletariats, no new International, and no enthusiastic fight by the world proletariat for the world revolution.

	Therefore another word or two about this.

	Wilson's aim: the independence and self-determination of all European nations and a League of Nations, is impossible. For the interests of all those nations are different; and there are some strong ones and some weak ones among them. This must, under Capitalism (divided into national Capitalisms as it still is) lead to dictation and oppression.

	It cannot be otherwise.

	It is extremely hypocritical on the part of England and America, after destroying the power of Germany, to grant independence to all European nations. For the interests of England and America make it necessary that no single Power on the Continent shall grow strong. Therefore this independence is only an appearance. It is merely a means to gain their end, and that is to make the European nations political and economic vassals of both Anglo-Saxon nations.

	The truth is this: there can be no independence under Imperialism. Should Germany win there would be set up a League of Nations in which the nations would not be independent, but simply subjects of Germany. Should the Allies win they would set up a League of Nations in which all would be weak except England and America; and their weakness would force them to submit to these two.

	The aim of both Imperialisms is the same: the subjection of the nations, command of the world, world-power, world-domination.

	Germany murders independence openly and cruelly; England and America allow it to exist in appearance, but kill it in reality.

	The difference is only apparent, not real.

	The difference between German and Anglo-American Imperialism is the same as that between Conservatism and Liberalism, between Absolution and Republicanism, between Aristocracy and Democracy.

	There is only one difference between the Imperialism of a reactionary absolutist autocracy and the Imperialism of Liberal republican democracy, and that is in appearance; in reality they are alike.

	Real independence cannot be attained under Capitalism, whether it be an autocracy or a democracy. Capitalism and Imperialism tend inevitably to the subjection of the nations.

	The reason is that the monopolistic banking interests in Germany, England, and the United States, are all-powerful, and rule the whole world. It is characteristic that, in regard to this matter, Capitalism is in a blind alley.

	This question, as so many others, can only be solved by Socialism.
