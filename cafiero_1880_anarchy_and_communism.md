At a congress held in Paris by the Centre region, one speaker, who stood
out because of his fierceness against anarchists, said: "Communism and
anarchy would scream to find themselves together."

Another speaker who also spoke against anarchists, though less harshly,
cried out, in speaking of economic equality:

"How can liberty be violated, if equality exists?"

Well! I think that both speakers are wrong.

There can absolutely be economic equality, without having liberty in the
slightest. Certain religious communities are living proof of this,
because the most complete equality exists there as well as despotism.
Complete equality, because the leader dresses himself in the same cloth
and eats at the same table as the others; he distinguishes himself in no
other way than by his right to command. And the supporters of the
"Popular state?" If they did not meet obstacles of any sort, I am
certain that they would eventually achieve perfect equality, but at the
same time as perfect despotism, because, let us not forget, the
despotism of the present State would augment economic despotism of all
capital that passed through the hands of the State, and all would be
multiplied by all the centralization necessary to this new State. And
that is why we, the anarchists, friends of liberty, propose an all-out
attack on them.

Thus, contrary to what was said, we have perfect reason to fear for
liberty, even where equality exists; though there can be no fear for
equality anywhere where true liberty exists, that is to say, anarchy.

Finally, anarchy and communism, far from screaming to find themselves
together, would scream at not finding themselves together, because these
two terms, synonyms of liberty and equality, are the two necessary and
indivisible terms of the revolution.

Our ideal revolutionary is very simple, we will see: he is composed,
like all of our predecessors, of these two terms: liberty and equality.
Only there is a slight difference.

Educated by the dodging that reactionaries of all sorts and of all times
have done of liberty and equality, we are wise to place next to these
two terms an expression of their exact value.

We thus place, next to these two terms: liberty and equality, two
equivalents of which the clear significance cannot give rise to
ambiguity, and we say: "We want liberty, that is to say, anarchy, and
equality, that is to say, communism."

Anarchy today is an attack, a war against all authority, against all
power, against all States. In future societies, anarchy will be a
defense, the prevention brought against the reestablishment of all
authority, of all power, of any State: full and entire liberty of the
individual who, freely and pushed only by his needs, by his tastes and
his liking, combines with other individuals in groups or partnership;
free development of partnership which federates itself with others in
the commune or in the neighborhood; free development of communes which
federate themselves in the region -- and so on: regions in the nation,
nations in humanity.

Communism, the question that occupies us most specifically today, is the
second point of our ideal revolutionary.

Communism today is still an attack; it is not the destruction of
authority, but the taking, in the name of humanity, of all the wealth
that exists on the globe. In the society of the future, communism will
be the enjoyment of all existing wealth, by all men and according to the
principle: From each according to his abilities, to each according to
his needs, that is to say: from each to each according to his will.

It is necessary to remark -- and this responds to our adversaries,
authoritarian and statist communists -- that the taking of possession
and the enjoyment of all existing wealth must be, according to us, the
doing of the people themselves. The people, humanity, not being
individuals capable of seizing wealth and taking it into their own two
hands, we must conclude, it is true, that it is necessary, for this
reason, to institute a ruling class, of representatives and agents of
the common wealth. But we do not share this opinion. No intermediaries,
no representatives who always end up representing nobody but themselves!
No moderators of equality, moreover, no moderators of liberty! No new
government, no new state, whether it calls itself popular or democratic,
revolutionary or provisional.

The common wealth being disseminated over the whole world, all rights to
it belonging to the entirety of humanity, those thus who find themselves
on the level of this wealth and in a position to use it will use it in
common. People of such a land will use the planet, the machines, the
workshops, the houses, etc., of the land and will serve everyone in
common of them. Parts of humanity, they will exercise here, de facto and
directly, their right to a part of the human wealth. But if a resident
of Peking came into this land, he would find himself with the same
rights as the others: he would enjoy with the others all the richness of
the country, in the same way that he did at Peking.

He was thus quite confused, that speaker who denounced anarchists as
wanting to set up property as belonging to corporations. Wouldn't that
be wonderful, if we had destroyed the State to replace it with a
multitude of smaller States! To kill the monster with one head to
entertain the monster with a thousand heads!

No, we have said it, and we will not stop saying it: no go-betweens, no
brokers or helpful servants who always end up becoming the true masters:
we want all the wealth existent to be taken directly by the people
themselves and to be kept by their powerful hands, and that the people
themselves decide the best way to enjoy it, be it for production or
consumption.

But people ask us: is communism applicable? Would we have enough
products to let everyone have the right to take as they wished, without
demanding from individuals more labor than they are willing to give?

We respond: yes. Certainly, we can apply this principle: from each
according to their ability, to each according to their need, because, in
future societies, production will be so abundant that there will be no
need to limit consumption, or to demand from people more work than they
are willing or able to give.

Right now, we cannot even begin to imagine this immense growth in
production, but we can guess at it by examining the causes that will
provoke it. These causes can be summed up in three principles:

1. Harmony of cooperation in the different branches of human activity
will replace today's fighting that translates into competition

2. Large-scale introduction of all kinds of machines

3. The considerable conservation of the forces of labor and of raw
materials, facilitated by the abolition of harmful or useless
production.

Competition, fighting, is one of the fundamental principles of
capitalist production, which has as its motto: _Mors tua vita mea_, your
death is my life. The ruin of one makes the fortune of another. And this
relentless fight happens from nation to nation, from region to region,
from individual to individual, between workers as well as between
capitalists. It's a war of the knife, a combat of all forms: body to
body, by groups, by squads, by army corps. A worker finds work where
another has lost it; one industry or many industries prosper where other
industries decline.

Well! Imagine when, in the society of the future, this individualistic
principle of capitalist production, every man for himself against all
others, and everyone against everyone, will be replaced by the true
principle of human society: all for one and one for all -- what immense
changes will we not obtain in the results of production? Imagine how
great will be the growth of production, when each man, far from needing
to fight against all the others, will be helped by them, when he will
have them not as enemies but as cooperators. If the collective work of
ten men attains results absolutely impossible for one man alone, how
grand will be the results obtained by the large-scale cooperation of all
men who, today, work hostilely against each other?

And machines? The appearance of these powerful helpers of work, as large
as it seems to us today, is quite minimal in comparison to what it will
be in societies to come.

Today, the machine often has the ignorance of the capitalist against it,
but more often still his interest. How many machines are going unapplied
only because they do not bring an immediate benefit to the capitalist?

Will a coal mining company, for example, go to great expense to
safeguard the interests of the workers and construct costly apparatuses
to help the miners descend into the shafts? Will the municipality
introduce a machine to break rocks, when this work gives it the means to
give cheap alms to the starving? So many discoveries, so many
applications of science go unheeded, only because they do not bring
enough to the capitalist!

The worker himself is today the enemy of machines, and rightfully so,
because they are to him the monster that comes to chase him from use, to
starve him, to degrade him, to torture him, to crush him. And what an
immense interest he would have, on the contrary, in augmenting their
number when he will no longer be at the service of machines; on the
contrary, they would be at his service, helping him and working for his
well-being!

Finally, it is necessary to take into account the huge savings that will
be made on the three elements of work: the force, the instruments and
the material, which are horribly wasted today, because they are used for
the production of absolutely useless things, when they are not harmful
to humanity.

How many workers, how much material, and how many tools are used today
by the armies of the land and sea to build ships, fortresses, cannons,
and all these arsenals of offensive and defensive arms! How many of
these forces are wasted to produce luxury objects that serve nothing but
the needs of vanity and corruption!

And when all this force, all these materials, all these tools are used
for industry, for the production of objects that themselves will serve
to produce, what a prodigious growth in production we will see
appearing!

Yes, communism is applicable! We can of course let everyone take
according to their will, since there will be enough for everyone. We
will no longer need to demand more work than anyone wants to give,
because there will always be enough products for tomorrow.

And it's thanks to this abundance that work will lose the dreadful
character of enslavement, in leaving to it only the charm of a moral and
physical need, like that of studying, of living with nature.

This is not just to say that communism is possible; we can affirm that
it is necessary. Not only may we be communist; we must be communist, or
else risk missing the point of the revolution.

In effect, after the collectivization of tools and raw materials, if we
conserve the individual appropriation of products of work, we will find
ourselves forced to save money, subsequently an accumulation of greater
or lesser wealth, according more or less to merit, or rather, to the
skill, of individuals. Equality would thus have disappeared, because
those who had managed to accumulate more wealth would already have been
thus elevated above the level of the others. There would no longer
remain more than one step before counter-revolutionaries could establish
the right of heritage. And, in effect, I heard a renowned socialist, a
so-called revolutionary, who supported the individual attribution of
products, finish by saying that he saw no drawbacks of a society that
accepted the passing on of these products by inheritance: this,
according to him, would be unlikely to have any repercussions. For those
of us who know closely the results at which society has arrived with
this accumulation of wealth and their passing on by inheritance, there
can be no doubt on this subject.

But the individual attribution of products would re-establish not only
inequality among men, but also inequality among different forms of work.
We would almost immediately see the reappearance of "clean" and "dirty"
work, of "noble" and "dreadful" work: the former would be done by the
rich, the latter would be the assignment of the poor. So it would no
longer be calling and taste that led a man to dedicate himself to one
type of activity as opposed to another: it would be self-interest, the
hope of gaining more in a certain profession. In this way, laziness and
diligence, merit and lack of merit, good and bad, vice and virtue, and,
by consequence, "reward" on one hand and "punishment" on the other, the
law, the judge, the henchman, the prison, would all reappear.

There are socialists who cling to supporting the idea of individual
attribution of products of work, arguing the sense of justice.

Strange illusion! With collective work, that imposes upon us the
necessity of large-scale production and large-scale implementation of
machines, with this ever-growing tendency of modern work to serve itself
of the work of preceding generations -- how will we be able to determine
which parts of the product belong to whom? It's absolutely impossible,
and our adversaries themselves know this so well that they end up saying
"Well, we will use as a basis for distribution the hours spent working,"
but, at the same time, they themselves admit that this would be unjust,
because three hours of work from Pierre might produce as much as five
hours of work from Paul.

In the old days, we called ourselves "collectivists" because this was
the word that distinguished us from individualists and from
authoritarian communists; but, in the end, we were all quite simply
anti-authoritarian communists, and, in calling ourselves
"collectivists," we thought we were expressing by this name our idea
that everything must be pooled, without distinguishing between the
instruments and materials of work and the products of collective work.

But, one day, we saw a new shade of socialists sprout up who,
resuscitating the errors of the past, admiring themselves
philosophizing, distinguishing themselves on this question, finished by
making themselves the apostles of the following thesis:

"There exist," they say, "use value and production value. Use value is
that which we use to satisfy our personal needs: the house we live in,
the food we consume, clothing, books, etc., while production value is
that which we use to produce: it is the workshop, the sheds, the
cowshed, the warehouse, the machines and tools of all sorts of work, the
sun, raw materials, etc. The former, which serve to satisfy the needs of
the individual," they say, "must be attributed to the individual, while
the latter, which help everyone to produce, should be commonly owned."

This is the newly discovered -- or rather, renewed as needed -- economic
theory.

But I ask you, you who give the favorable title of "production value" to
the carbon that feeds machines, to the oil that serves to oil it, to the
oil that illuminates its work -- why do you refuse this title to bread,
to the meat I eat, to the oil with which I season my salad, to the gas
that illuminates my work, to all that aids the living and working of
that most perfect of all machines, the father of all machines: the man?

You class as production value the meadow and the stable that serve to
shelter cows and horses, and you exclude the houses and the gardens that
serve the most noble of all the animals: the man?

Where is your logic?

Besides, you yourselves who imagine yourselves as the apostles of this
theory, you know perfectly well that this demarcation does not exist in
reality, and that if it is difficult to draw it today, it will disappear
completely the day that we are all producers as well as being consumers.

Thus, it is not this theory, we see, which could give a new force to the
supporters of individual attributions of the products of labor. This
theory has only obtained one result: that of unmasking the game of these
few socialists who would like to limit the range of revolutionary
thought; it has opened our eyes and shown us the necessity of saying
straight out that we are communists.

But finally, let's address the one and only serious objection that our
adversaries have brought against communism.

We all agree that we are necessarily moving towards communism, but we
observe that at the beginning, products will not be abundant enough; it
will be necessary to establish rations and to divide up resources, and
that the best part of the products of labor will be based on the
quantity of work that each person has done.

To this we respond that, in a future society, even when we are obligated
to ration resources, we must remain communists: this is to say that the
rationing must be done according not to merits, but to needs.

Take the family, that small model of communism (of an authoritarian
communism more than anarchist, it is true, which, besides, in our
example, changes nothing).

In the family, let's suppose that the father brings home a hundred cents
every day, the eldest son three francs, a younger boy forty cents, and
the youngest only five cents a day. Each brings this money to the mother
who keeps the cash and feeds them. Everyone earns different amounts, but
at dinner, everyone serves themselves as they please according to their
appetites; there is no rationing. But the bad days come, and being
entirely broke forces the mother to no longer rely on the appetite and
taste of each person for distribution at dinner. It is necessary to
ration and, be it by the initiative of the mother or by the tacit
agreement of the whole table, the portions are reduced. But see, this
sharing does not happen according to earnings, because it's the youngest
children who receive the most generous helpings, and the best piece of
the meat is reserved for the old woman who earns nothing at all. Even
during a food shortage, the family operates on the principle of
rationing according to needs. Could it be otherwise in the human family
of the future?

It is obvious that there would be more to say on this subject, if I were
not speaking in front of anarchists.

We cannot be anarchists without being communists. In effect, the
slightest idea of limitation already contains the seeds of
authoritarianism. It could not be realized without immediately creating
the law, the judge, the policeman.

We must be communists because it is in communism that we will realize
true equality. We must be communists because the people, who do not
understand the collectivist sophistry, understand communism perfectly,
as our friends Reclus and Kropotkin have already remarked. We must be
communists, because we are anarchists, because anarchy and communism are
the two terms necessary for the revolution.
