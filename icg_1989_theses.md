## Introduction

These programmatical theses constitute a document on which our group has
been working for many years, even before the "official" birth of ICG in
June 1979. They represent a synthesis of work on a permanent level of
international discussion, criticism, increasing depth and elaboration,
realised historically by revolutionary militants. It is this activity
which permits an ever more precise delimitation of the programmatical
theses of our movement, communism.[^01]

On this question, as on all others, we totally and simultaneously reject
the ideology of formal invariance (the orthodoxy of form) as well as
that of all kinds of revisionist innovators (the heterodoxy of content).
As our theses indicate, we oppose them with a constantly deepening and
ever more precise determination of the programmatical implications
invariably contained in the communist struggle.

This is why these theses are neither the umpteenth version of some
sacred text nor a conglomeration of ideas susceptible to being changed,
in total or in part, according to the will of some or other militants
(even if in the majority). They are rather an expression, a "snapshot"
of a moment of permanent collective activity of programmatical
restoration, of which there were formulations in the past and certainly
will be in the future, but which are all present on the historical line
seeking to express theoretically the communist practice of rupture from
the whole capitalist society.

As far as this eminently practical theoretical activity is concerned,
the work of communist factions is always the same: To perceive and
express, against all ideologies, what in the immediate reality announces
the historical future, what within and against capitalism constitutes
its negation and announces communism, to _synthesize_ the experience
accumulated in the development of revolution and counterrevolution. It
is concerned with an indispensable part of _communist action_, not only
in the sense that communist factions constitute a part of and a
_coherent organic expression_ of the movement of destruction of the
present society, but also because it is through them that _the
proletariat_ condenses its experiences and transforms them into
_directives_ for future action or, better said, _COMMUNISM THUS
ENGENDERS ITS HISTORICAL DIRECTION_.[^02]

So for us the problem is neither to invent "new theories" (which always
implies repeating the same old crap in a new form) nor to discover new
"historical subjects", nor to promote "new practices". On the contrary,
we have to continue to demonstrate the invariable consequences of the
contradiction between capitalism and communism, present ever since
Capital conquered production and subsumed the whole of humanity in its
being.

The advantage of such a document is that it allows us to set out in a
very synthesized and global manner the whole of the fundamental
positions that direct our activity and it can serve as an explicit
reference of the programmatical framework within which our militancy
develops. At the same time this kind of text has the disadvantage of
being easily considered by fetishists of form as being an A to Z of
revolutionary theory, who consider that, once formulated, it would be
able to solve all the problems with which the communist movement will be
confronted, however embryonic and dispersed it may be today. On our
part, we consider these theses to be an acquired base, the result of
several years of militant activity and which will serve to direct and
demarcate our future militancy.

The theses of communists are not and never have been "theorizations"
about how the world should be reformed, inventions or ideological
nonsense. On the contrary, they are the theoretical expression of the
real movement of abolition of the existing order. As such, they
synthesize the real and practical determinations of the proletariat in
its subversive movement, forming at the same time a decisive and
indispensable part in the practice of this movement in its struggle to
give itself a revolutionary direction and to constitute itself as a
worldwide historical force.

Throughout the centuries-old history of the Communist Party, the theses
of communists have been asserted, developed themselves and become more
and more precise along with the very development of the revolutionary
movement (including the lessons learnt from its successive defeats).
However, this does not mean that the successive formulations of these
theses can be left to be freely interpreted nor that they lend
themselves to any of many boasting innovations. As theoretical
expressions of the invariant antagonism between capitalism and
communism, these successive formulations are necessarily imperfect and
unfinished. We can assert that all formal manifestos produced throughout
the history of the party and up to the total victory of communist
revolution contain and will continue to contain various erroneous
positions or even positions alien to the interests of the proletariat.
Nevertheless, each one of these successive formulations, insofar as they
are real concretisations of the communist direction of the movement,
reaffirms -- on a different level of abstraction -- the invariant
foundations of this movement. This is why each generation of
revolutionaries does not start again from scratch but, on the contrary,
its practical activity is directed by invariant foundations that must
not be revised, but must be developed and pushed forward to their
ultimate consequences.

In opposition to this revolutionary activity, counter-revolution,
especially social-democracy as the general party of formal
pseudo-continuity and real programmatical revision, does exactly the
opposite. Even when it claims it is the heir to proletarian leaders from
the past, it uses only isolated quotes, taken out of context in the name
of formal orthodoxy, yet always attacks the very foundations of the
invariant antagonism. The whole revisionist production is based on a
general reinterpretation of capitalism, on a supposed change in the
nature of capitalism and consequently of the proletarian struggle in
order to define its invariant counter-revolutionary programme.

It seems indispensable here to give an example of what we've just stated
which will clarify the reading and general meaning of our theses.

**"THE PROLETARIAT HAS NO HOMELAND"** is a central and invariant thesis
of our party all along its history. It contains and determines a whole
series of fundamental practical orientations. But what is the origin of
this assertion and what are its implications? Contrary to what bourgeois
_Marxism_ pretends, this decisive thesis is not the invention of some
brilliant theoretician, but expresses the reality, the very life of the
proletariat.

In this way, in the first Manifesto of the Communist Party (deserving of
this name, in the full sense of the word) Marx and Engels formulated a
reality that up until then, in different forms, had been part of this
ABC of the communist movement and which all subsequent formulations of
the Programme have taken up since.

But the reality of the proletariat having no homeland is not a
contingent reality, nor a reality that can be given dates of a beginning
or an end, nor should it be confused with its first theoretical
formulation. It is, on the contrary, an **essential and permanent**
reality of the proletariat as an historical being, determining it in
opposition to the whole bourgeois system. As the **negation** of this
bourgeois society, it contains **decisive definitions of the society to
come** (the abolition of all nationality, of all borders, etc.).

Put differently, before Marx and Engels ever formulated it, this
invariant reality of the communist movement in opposition to any country
was already a reality: the proletariat never had and never will have a
homeland. Its own existence contains the abolition of all nationality
.[^03]

So we shouldn't be surprised that other more or less clear expressions
of this central aspect of the communist programme have also been
formulated in other parts of the world, before or after this Manifesto,
by other communist militants who didn't even know about Marx or Engels
-- because they are merely expressions of the life and practice of our
class.

The theoretical assertion of this extremely explicit thesis in the
Manifesto, marks a **decisive and irreversible** forward step of the
party itself. It became an essential basis for all subsequent
formulations from which there is no going back and it constituted itself
as a war cry for the proletariat in struggle.

This is not the place to detail the progression that led militants like
Marx and Engels to formulate this thesis. But it is important to stress
that this thesis is not only a **negation** in its form, but also in
its content, inasmuch as the real movement of the proletariat **is**
the negation of the homeland -- essential in order to understand the
methodology of the theses that we are presenting below.

The general method of the exposition -- the opposition
communism/capitalism and, during capitalism, communism as its practical
negation -- is founded on the fact that all positive programmatical
determinations are contained negatively within Capital itself (including
counter-revolutionary experiences). Better said, under the reign of
capitalism, **communism, as the revolutionary movement**, is this
negation.

It is not possible to go through all the theses that are indissociably
linked to the central assertion that "the proletariat has no homeland",
nor can we mention all the conclusions and implications that Marx and
Engels deduced from it. However, we want to stress that it is based on a
certain level of perception of Capital as a worldwide reality, of
communism as a universal movement and of internationalism as a decisive
element in the practice of the proletariat. Without these invariant
bases, the cry of "Proletarians of all countries, unite", as well as the
directly internationalist conception of the party and of the programme
(the Manifesto itself does not have a homeland!!!) would have been no
more than empty phrases. What is decisive in the historical line of the
party is the continuity from generation to generation of
revolutionaries, which is not about inventing or revising anything but
developing in their own revolutionary practice the determinations
contained within the real subversive existing movement.

Revisionism does exactly the opposite. It may or may not use quotations
from Marx or Engels or any other revolutionary leader, but its
_invariant_ characteristic will always be to question the very
foundations of the practical determinations of the proletariat. For
this purpose, it will always, absolutely always, start by saying that
the society has changed, that capitalism is not the same as before, that
the workers' struggle has changed as well... and then it ends up
defending anything, even the homeland. On this question, let's look at
what Bernstein wrote:

>"But has social democracy, as the party of the working class and peace,
an interest in keeping the proletariat defensive of the nation? There
are various reasons which would push one towards a negative response,
above all if one takes as the starting point the assertion of the
Communist Manifesto: The proletariat has no homeland. Yet this
assertion may be a lot more valid for the workers in the forties [^04]
who lacked political rights and access to public life; but currently it
has already lost a great deal of its veracity... and will continue to
lose it more and more as the worker ceases to be a proletarian and is
transformed into a citizen.
>
>The worker who, in the state, in the municipalities... is an elector
having the same rights and participating for the common good of the
nation; the worker whose children are educated and whose health is
protected by the community, in the same way that it guarantees him
security against misfortunes... this worker will before long have a
fatherland by the very fact of being a citizen of the world; in the same
way that nations become closer together without losing their own
individuality...
>
>Currently there is a lot of talk about the conquest of political power
by social democracy and in any case, judging by the strength which it
has achieved in Germany, it is not impossible that a series of political
events could lead it in a short period of time to assume a decisive role
in this country. But precisely because of such an eventuality and taking
into account the distance which separates the neighbouring peoples from
this objective, social democracy must assume a national character...
>
>This is an indispensable condition for maintaining its power. It must
prove its aptitude as the ruling party and a ruling class, in being up
to the task of safeguarding, with the same firmness, class interests and
the interests of the nation." - Bernstein, _The Premises of Socialism
and the Tasks of Social Democracy_, Ch. IV, Texts and Possibilities of
Social Democracy.

There is no need for us to stress any further the very clear political
consequences of such a methodology of revision. However, in general,
things are far more complicated. Indeed, Marx and Engels themselves did
not draw all the inferences from this essential thesis of the communist
programme, in the same way, for example, that the generation of
revolutionaries of 1917 did not manage to assume the implications of
other central theses of the programme, such as "destruction of the
bourgeois state" or "abolition of wage labour", etc. On the basis of an
un-finished reappropriation of this reality of the proletariat "that has
no homeland", Marx and Engels oscillated between different positions on
the national question, defended some totally contradictory positions,
many times directly antagonistic to proletarian internationalism. The
ambiguities of Marx and Engels on social-democracy (the very basis of
the constitution of which was antagonistic to this thesis, i.e. national
parties for the defence of democracy!!!) were also related to this only
partial programmatical reappropriation; and so was the fact that Engels
completely revised this central thesis to demand German national defence
and participation in imperialist war. Indeed, between the thesis that
asserts that "the proletariat has no homeland" with its immediate
consequences (internationalism, directly international organisation of
the proletariat, opposition to the nationalism of one's "own"
bourgeoisie, consequences which all arise from the very life of the
proletariat fighting against its direct exploiters and thus develop an
internationalist practice) and Engels' nationalist, bourgeois,
imperialist position of 1891, when the outbreak of war between the
German state and the Russian and French states appeared imminent, there
lies an abyss, a very profound **programmatical rupture, a complete
revision**.

Remember that Engels stated that if Germany were attacked "all means of
defence would be good; we would have to launch attacks on the Russians
and their allies, whoever they may be" and he even suggested that in
those circumstances "we might perhaps be the sole truly warmongering and
determined party"! [^05] As is well-known, this is exactly the
pro-imperialist position that social-democracy went on to develop.

This example allows us to show clearly why counter-revolution and
revisionism could, and still can, in many cases, play at orthodoxy (the
general practice of the "Marxist" wing of social-democracy whose great
ideologue was Kautsky) either because Marx and Engels themselves
developed the implications of this thesis only halfway, or because
Engels himself revised this thesis completely, under the pretext -- as
always -- of particular conditions of capitalism at that moment.

To this, we oppose the historical attitude of communists. For us, it is
not a matter of modifying this central thesis, nor putting it on the
same level as a whole of contingent and confused sentences that go along
with it (like stating that the struggle of the proletariat will be
international only in its contents but not in its form.[^06] Neither do
we want to follow Marx or Engels throughout their full or partial
renunciations. Without doubt, the issue must be to develop all the
consequences of this thesis. However, such a development is neither
ideological nor invented. It is not a question of sitting at a desk and
trying to invent further clarifications. No, for us it was struggle
itself, the gigantic opposition between revolution and
counter-revolution that clearly marked the frontier between
participation in the wars of national liberation or any other
imperialist wars on the one hand and revolutionary defeatism on the
other; this permitted a theoretical and everlasting understanding of the
other implications that Marx and Engels had not yet assumed. Since then,
revolutionary defeatism and internationalism have constituted a truly
appropriated basis, a fundamental starting-point for successive
generations of revolutionaries. **It is in this manner, through
successive programmatical reappropriation, that the whole of the theses
of communism develop and assert themselves!**

This permits a clarification of the real contradiction between the
invariant programme and the constantly developing theoretical theses of
communists. It is this contradiction that all formalists (who defend the
invariance of the theoretical programme of Marx and Engels), all
revisionists and all "innovators" come up against.

The proletariat does not have a homeland and never did have one. In
reality, the proletariat acts as such only when it is struggling against
exploitation, against "its" own bourgeois and against "its" own state.
Such practice is part of the true community of international and
internationalist struggle that the communist vanguard struggles to
centralise effectively: this is and always has been a central axis of
communism.

Marx did not invent the communist programme: he only expressed a level
of its appropriation. In the beginning of the century and all over the
world, the communist left did not invent anything either during its
fight against imperialist war, but synthesized, by means of theses,
central slogans and precise directives, the reality of the communist
movement.

Our task is exactly the same. These theses [^07] reflect one further
step in the collective, impersonal, international effort of the
communist programme asserting itself generation after generation.

Consequently these theses, that guide and will guide the conscious and
organised activity of our small group, are not our property (we do not
claim their paternity). They are a synthetic expression of the sum of
experiences of our class and of our party throughout history and, as
such, belong to them only.

Different texts have been published in our central and agitative reviews
(in Spanish, French, English, Arabic, Portuguese, German, Turkish,
Hungarian, Kurdish...) that develop and explain these theses and
constitute the basis of the process of their historical appropriation,
which is why we've published a summary of the main texts that have been
published in French and Spanish so far, as an annexe to these theses. It
is important to note that if, on some subjects, the texts are elaborated
in far greater depth than the few lines on that subject in the relevant
thesis this is because, for a large number of them, the task remains
embryonic and an enormous amount remains to be done (this revolutionary
task can only be completely achieved by the very realisation of social
revolution). These theses are not some mythical point of arrival but
are working theses, a synthesis of our practice on the basis of which we
continue our activities. We leave the belief that any text could
guarantee against deviations, betrayals, splits, etc to political
paranoiacs. The only guarantee that we have comes from the globality of
our implication, resides in our adhesion not to a group, to a party or
to a leader, but _to communism_, to the real movement of abolition of
everything that separates us from ourselves. But, dialectically, this
movement only exists when it centralises itself, organises itself,
directs itself, i.e. when it constitutes itself as party.

The organisation, preparation, structuring and leadership of this party
is the impersonal production of factions, groups, militants who have
forever assumed the task of the international **formation** of
revolutionary cadres and of the preparation of the worldwide leadership
of the communist revolution.

Our central preoccupation, since the formation of the ICG, has been and
is to assume, according to our limited forces and the present state of
the communist movement, all the tasks and necessities of the movement.
What characterizes communists practically is **not** their assuming one
or other task according to the period, as the only one that can be
realised (tasks which for some may be "theoretical", for others
"propagandist" and for others "military"). If this were the case, then
communists would differentiate themselves from the rest of the
proletariat by entirely partial determinations, taking on a number of
minor tasks compared to the rest of the proletarian movement.

On the contrary, the essence of revolutionary praxis is to assume _all_
tasks and necessities of the movement whilst, of course, taking into
account the balance of forces and the priorities that it determines. All
these tasks must be assumed while always putting forward the historical
and worldwide interests of the movement; these determine themselves not
in relation to immediate or contingent situations, but always in
relation to the totality, to communism. This and only this, is the
historical line of the reconstitution of the **PARTY**.

If the written expressions of life and of the struggle have always been
criticised by militants (a logical expression of the dynamics of life
regarding things that are set in writing and thus fixed), we must also
remember that language itself is a veil produced by the domination of
Capital, through which it is extremely difficult to communicate any
content escaping this domination: the same contradiction is ever-present
when we express a movement through language that only allows for set
categories. Similarly, a concept may express a different content in
different languages, according to different realities lived by the
proletariat.

To fill these gaps and to lessen the burden of these weaknesses which we
know are unavoidable, we have tried to work on these theses in four
different languages so as to unify the expressions of the reality we
want to transmit. The result of this is a rather "impure" and "heavy"
language. On top of this, the content of concepts that have been
historically and socially defined does not have the same meaning for us
as for the citizen, not even the most politicised amongst them. This is
the case, for instance, for expressions like "party", "proletariat",
"class", "democracy", "Capital"; on these points it is necessary to take
the contributions that we've produced on these various subjects as a
reference.

The translation of our main contributions into different languages,
reflects this effort for centralisation and homogenization in our
central reviews. To stress this tendency towards homogenization, and
because we feel it is more appropriate, we've decided to call all our
central reviews "Communism" (our French central review used to be called
"The Communist"). With respect to continuity between our publications
the following statement by Bordiga in 1953 is clear enough:

>"To follow the continuity of our contributions, our readers should not
feel bothered by the changes of the titles of our reviews, changes that
occur because of different episodes of minor events. Our contributions
can easily be recognised through their indivisible organicity. It is
typical of the bourgeois to put a label on each commodity produced, to
put the name of an intellectual on each idea, to define each party
through its leader... but on the proletarian side it is clear that when
the mode of exposition examines the objective relationship of reality,
this can never be reduced to the personal opinions of stupid
competitors, to the praise or insults for heavyweights or
featherweights. In this case, the judgment is not defined by contents
but by the good or bad faith of the person who's pleading. Our task is
hard and difficult but it will only achieve its aims while respecting
its own nature and without using the artifices of bourgeois publicity
techniques, without using the dirty tendency to worship men." - ("_Fil
du Temps_" - 1953)

This is why our "Programmatical Theses" are not some "platform" in the
reduced, conformist and showy sense in which various sects define
themselves as the centre of the earth. The communist programme is not a
biblical text guaranteeing against all possible deviations, a tablet of
stone to cling to in order to safeguard virginal purity. In this way the
term platform has been mystified with the intention of making it pass
for a synonym of communist programme (as if it were possible to reduce
the communist programme to any text, whichever it was!).
Counter-revolution claims such a platform will be a formal guarantee for
the future. Moreover, pretension of pretensions, it also claims that it
contains the answers to all questions raised by proletarian struggles.
It was against such fetishism of "platforms", of "programmes", that Marx
asserted, more than a century ago, that one forward step of the real
movement was worth more than a dozen programmes.

To all fetishists of platforms and of ideal parties, to all militants of
formalistic invariance who believe they will not deviate an inch because
they trot out a platform or recite phrases by some or other proletarian
leader, we can easily recall their readiness to adopt new phrases, new
platforms, a new group, new practices and to insult their former
comrades... Finally, to all those who hide their miserable
individualism, their sectarianism and federalism behind fine words on
the ideal "party" or the perfection of "revolutionary cadres", basing
themselves on quotations of the leaders of the past, we counter them
with something we wrote some time ago in our central French review
(Intro, "Le Communiste" No. 6):

>"For us communists, what really matters is not some or other quotation
from Marx, Lenin or Bordiga, nor some or other position taken up at a
certain moment. What really matters is to grasp the invariant
**content**, beyond its more or less clear expressions, to grasp the
red thread linking the communist practice of always, **to be on the
side of the proletarian struggle against all capitalist barriers**.
Beyond the understanding at a particular moment, beyond formal
expressions, beyond consciousness expressed by proletarian banners or
texts the real immediate struggle of the working class against
exploitation, has always been -- yesterday, today and tomorrow --
**anti-frontist, antidemocratic, anti-national**."

Our enemy, the capitalist social relationship personified by the
bourgeois class, has always been the same. Our necessities and demands
will also always be the same: the struggle against exploitation, against
the intensity and extension of labour... Our methods of struggle, direct
action (revolutionary violence and terrorism), organisation outside and
against all structures of the bourgeois state, armed insurrection, the
worldwide dictatorship of the proletariat for the abolition of wage
labour... have always been the same. It is to this **real
invariance**, to this real organic continuity between the communist
factions of yesterday and today, that we want to contribute by means of
these programmatical theses.

-- Internationalist Communist Group, 1989

## Theses

1: The huge problems facing humanity today -- exploitation, misery, war,
famine, alienated and estranged labour, mass unemployment, ... -- are
inherent to, and the necessary products of, capitalist progress and
barbarity. They can only be properly confronted (and understood) if,
instead of being seen in isolation, they are tackled in the context of
their driving force -- the capitalist system, history's last class
society, in other words, a transitory society which is at the same time
a moment of an historical arch spanning from primitive communities to
communism, and a moment of the process of creating the material
conditions for the institution of worldwide communist society. Communism
will not mean the end of human history. Communism, the formation of a
universal community of human beings will, on the contrary, signal the
genesis of truly human history, resulting from the abolition of private
property, social classes, the state, etc.

2: The primitive community was destroyed by its own limits. Human
beings, in producing the conditions for their own survival (expanded
reproduction), developed their needs and exploded the narrow framework
of this limited community. Exchange between communities (communities
ended where exchange of commodities began) gradually subsumed and
revolutionised their internal reality, thus bringing about the split
between the use of objects for immediate needs -- use value -- and their
use as objects by way of which others can be procured through exchange
-- the basis of exchange value. This brought about the historical
dissolution of these communities and the beginning of the cycle of
value.

3: If we consider the immediate result of this process, the world seems
to have been divided into innumerable different societies, each one with
a different mode of immediate production: proslavery, Germanic, Asiatic,
etc. If, however, we consider the process from the point of view of its
higher outcome: the development of money up to its transformation into
**world capital** -- a necessary condition for the institution of
communism -- the existence of itinerant trade and usurious capitalism
can be found very early on in the ancient world (pre-capitalist in the
strictest sense of the word, that is pre-existing capitalism), their
expansion already containing all the antecedents of world capitalism as
well as the subsumption of all immediate modes of preexisting
production.

4: In all pre-capitalist social formations, despite the limited
character of political, national and religious, ... etc. determinations,
man always saw himself as the aim of production: exchange was no more
than a means to an end. In generalized commodity production, in
opposition to all pre-capitalist societies, self-enrichment became the
supreme goal and money the be all and end all. Its accumulation became
the determining factor above all others (money as a means of exchange,
circulation...) and thus, as a result of a vast process, money imposed
itself as the only being human beings have in common, as the only
community that unifies them. The development of exchange compelled
Capital to conquer production, making production man's aim and
self-enrichment the objective of production.

5: This historic process of the transformation of money into capital is
a process of concentration and international centralisation of capital
and, at the same time, a process of separating the producer from his
objective conditions of production (the creation of the free worker by
way of state terrorism). Put another way, it is a process of violent
expropriation of all producers who, deprived of the means of life, are
forced to become wage slaves. By globally subsuming all previous modes
of production and developing the material conditions for its own
destruction, capitalism became a system which is no more than a _mere
transitional form_ towards a classless society for all humanity, that is
the last phase of the cycle of class societies. It is in this sense that
its destruction will mark the end of the prehistory of humanity.

6: Capitalism is differentiated from all previous modes of production by
its **universal** essence -- a condition for the unification of the
whole of humanity -- and also by the simplification/exacerbation of
class contradiction: society is divided into two great enemy camps, two
classes in direct confrontation, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

Through its development, capitalism creates the conditions for its own
suppression, not only by creating the arms which will wipe it off the
planet, but also and above all, by producing and concentrating those who
will take up the arms: the proletariat.

7: The proletariat is the inheritor of all previous exploited classes
because its conditions of survival bring the inhumanity of the living
conditions of all past exploited classes to crisis point and because all
the most profound objectives of their previous struggles are
concentrated within it. Nevertheless, the proletariat is distinguished
from the exploited classes of the past in that those classes did not
have a social project of their own and it was materially impossible for
their struggles to go beyond the framework of simple reactions
attempting to reconstitute the lost old community in an a-historical and
utopian way.

With the proletariat, the age-old struggle against exploitation,
dehumanisation and the subordination of human life to the dictatorship
of value, is assumed for the first time in history by a revolutionary
subject, that is to say a subject with its own social project, valid for
the whole of humanity and in complete rupture with the civilisation
brought by progress: the destruction of capital (and by this, classes),
exploitation, private property, all states... and thus the bringing
about of communism.

This struggle is therefore not only the reaction of an exploited class,
but also and above all, the action of a revolutionary class historically
forced to assume its programme and to constitute itself into the
worldwide communist party (the overturning of praxis in the most global
sense of this concept).

8: Classes do not exist initially "in themselves" (as themselves,
defined by production or by the economy) and subsequently "in struggle"
(involved in politics). They only exist as opposed and antagonistic
organic forces. They therefore define themselves in practice by their
movement of opposition and struggle inherent in the relations of
"production" and in the antagonistic interests which they imply. Not
"production" in the immediate sense of referring exclusively to the
production of things, but in the global sense, as the reproduction of
the species, reproduction of exploitation, reproduction of two
irreconcilable camps: exploited and exploiters, the reproduction of
private property and an ever-growing mass of beings deprived by the
property of others, deprived of all necessary means of ensuring their
conditions of life... and, finally, the ever more intense reproduction
of the antagonism between property owners (defenders of the world of
private property) and those whose very existence opposes itself to them
in the totality of their practical life in this world.

Therefore proletariat and bourgeoisie are defined by their mutual
antagonism: the bourgeoisie as the personification of the capitalist
relations of production, as the party of conservation, as a reactionary
force; the proletariat as the negation of the whole of present society,
as the party of destruction, bearer of communism.

9: The contradiction particular to bourgeois society is present at the
very heart of Capital, which has subsumed the whole of humanity. Capital
can only realise its own essence -- as value which valorises itself --
by developing and revolutionising the productive forces. This has the
consequence of reducing the socially necessary labour time for the
production of all commodities or, to put it another way, this produces a
general devalorisation of all products, of labour power and of all
productive capital. That is to say that both the starting point and the
goal of production - the self-valorisation of capital -- enters into an
insurmountable contradiction with the very means which it has put into
action: revolutionising productive forces = devalorisation. This appears
in every crisis with the massive destruction of productive forces which
makes the invariably reactionary character of the capitalist relations
of production evident and causes the contradiction with the productive
forces to explode -- contradiction that only the revolutionary
proletariat can push to its ultimate consequences.

10: Capital is just as incapable of abolishing economic anarchy (its own
law!) as it is of abolishing the proletariat (bearer of communism!), the
sole producer of value, value without which capital cannot exist.
Capital tries to increase the valorisation of particular capitals but
only realises itself by slowing down the rhythm of valorisation in
general, which translates into increasingly powerful phases of
expansion, inescapably concluded by crises, each one deeper and more
brutal than the last, challenging the very existence of the whole
capitalist social system economically, socially, ideologically and
politically.

11: Democracy was born of the dissolution of the primitive community,
the development of exchange, the commodity, private property, class
society, the historic creation of the individual, of the separation of
human beings from themselves in the production of their lives. Its
development is the development of the dictatorship of value over human
need, the development of state terrorism against the exploited classes.
With the total domination of value valorising itself and the total
domination of the fetishistic character of the commodity -- capitalist
terrorism -- democracy reaches its peak. This does not concern a
particular sphere or a simple form of domination, but rather the
invariant essence which perpetuates capital's society -- by atomising
and unifying on a fictive basis. By subsuming all aspects of life,
democracy practically denies the existence of classes with irreparably
antagonistic interests in order to affirm the only community which
belongs to it: the community of money. This reproduces the free
individual-citizen, national competing-being, whose corollary is the
people -- all within the framework of the structures of parties and
unions which make up the state.

12: Democratic rights and liberties are nothing else but the juridical
codification of capitalist social relationships. They relate men as
buyers and sellers of commodities and particularly as the buyers and
sellers of the labour-force commodity. This codification is thus the
practical negation of the proletariat as a class. The owners of
commodities meet as juridically free and equal subjects. But this
relationship of freedom and equality between owners is no more than the
reified relationship between bourgeoisie and proletariat, the
relationship between the former as exclusive owners of the means of
production, and the latter as dispossessed of everything except their
own labour-force. The kingdom of private property for the bourgeoisie
signifies the kingdom of total dispossession for the proletariat.

Democratic rights and liberties, as ideological mechanisms that ensure
and really assert the atomisation of the proletariat as citizens free to
sell their labour force, only able to find a buyer if capital needs it
for its valorisation, are instruments of coercion, violence and
despotism, in that they impose free and mutual competition between
proletarians forced to produce ever more value or to starve to death,
and therefore constitute a decisive weapon of democracy, that is of
bourgeois domination.

13: The bourgeois ideologies -- expressions of the limited understanding
of the bourgeoisie, whose point of view does not go beyond the horizon
of its own system of exploitation -- permanently conceal the real
dimension of the polarisation of society between bourgeoisie and
proletariat. The bourgeoisie therefore explains democracy from its own
democratic point of view; it starts out from its own immediatist and
a-historical point of view to explain society, thus concealing the
transitional character of its mode of production. More particularly, the
bourgeoisie conceals the revolutionary force, the only force capable of
wiping out this society: **the proletariat**. The proletariat, as
opposed to the bourgeoisie, does not fear historical evolution and
consequently does not resort to nor require any ideology whatsoever. It
affirms its class dictatorship as the negation of all classes and as the
process of its self-negation. Its own being is the negation of
capitalist society. The catastrophic nature of capital forces the
proletariat to constitute itself as an international force to sweep away
the whole of the social system and all its ideologies.

14: The very development of democracy sees to it that the present
importance of the simplification/exacerbation of the contradictions of
capitalism is being concealed by the permanent obliteration of class
frontiers. This is affirmed by specific ideological forms which develop
total confusion in this respect, mainly those based on a complicated set
of juridical and formal statutes that supposedly divide society -- not
into two antagonistic classes -- but into an indeterminate number of
more or less vague and elastic categories.

This is how, for instance, at one pole of society, a whole of juridical
forms conferring pseudo-waged status tends to camouflage the bourgeois
nature of entire structures of the state. This is the case, for
instance, for army and police officers or for high level officials in
administration or in industry, for bureaucrats of all kinds... who,
under this cover, are classified as neutral categories, without any
class-belonging, or worse still, are assimilated into "working class
social groups".

At the other pole of society the same is happening: a whole of juridical
forms of pseudo-owners -- "peasant" cooperatives, agrarian reforms,
artisans, ... -- which objectively camouflage the existence of huge
masses of proletarians, associated by capital for the production of
surplus-value (the wage character disguised). This and other ideological
mechanisms tend to present us as being opposed to each other and as
having different interests from those of other sections of the
proletariat: urban/agricultural, active/unemployed, men/women,
"workers"/employees, manual/intellectual workers, ...

This complicated ideological process contributes to maintaining the
regime of bourgeois exploitation and oppression, concealing our enemy
and making it diffuse and presenting our class as divided and
numerically weak. The whole secret of the perpetuation of bourgeois
domination can be summed up as being due to the proletariat's difficulty
in recognizing itself for what it really is, in recognizing its own
struggle in the struggle of its class brothers (in whatever part of the
world, and whatever categories the bourgeoisie might be using to divide
it). This recognition is an indispensable condition for its constitution
as an historical force.

In its turn this infernal cycle is broken in successive expressions of
the catastrophe of the system, by the struggles of the proletariat, by
their generalization and tendency to coincide in time, thus unveiling,
each time more strongly, the affirmation of the same negation of
capitalist society as a totality. This negation is determined, beyond
its protagonists' consciousness (always limited to communist
minorities), by the same interests and the same historical project.

15: In periods of revolutionary crisis, the two classes unite against
each other on the basis of their reciprocal antagonism.

On the side of the bourgeoisie, despite the tireless struggles between
its different fractions to assert their particular interests in the
distribution of the means of production and markets, as soon as the
armed proletariat appears and the spectre of communism rises up, all
inter-bourgeois rivalry becomes of secondary importance to make way for
the worldwide bourgeoisie, assembled around the most coherent, strongest
and most determined faction, the one best able to face class war.
Although the counter-revolution generally confronts its historical enemy
in this way, it is obviously not prevented from combining in other
special ways: one of which is the repolarisation of society into two
inter-bourgeois groups, both of which attempt to contain the
proletariat.

In fact, successive counter-revolutions confirm the flexibility with
which the bourgeoisie is able not only to alternate unification with
internal polarisation, but also to unite in the defence of an
inter-bourgeois polarisation to confront the revolution (a false
polarisation relative to that of class against class).

On the side of the proletariat, as soon as it breaks the chains of
competition and joins together in its struggle against its historical
enemy, it asserts itself as a force and as a party by centralising
itself around the most coherent, strongest and most determined factions,
the ones best able to confront capital. In this sense, it is without
doubt that there are sectors of the proletariat that are strategically
important because of their ability to paralyse the decisive centres of
accumulation of capital (major industries, mines, transport,
communication, etc.). These sectors are not always the most determined,
nor those who best guarantee the generalisation of the revolution. There
are other sectors, such as those without a job in general or young
proletarians in particular who have not yet found (or know that they
will never be able to find) a buyer for their labour power -- sectors
which are often camouflaged by a-classist denominations such as
"youths", "students" or "school-kids". These sectors can play a decisive
role in the qualitative step of the movement that always implies rupture
from the narrow framework of the factory, by taking to and occupying the
streets, by the effective generalisation of the struggle and by the
transition to territorial associationism in the face of which the
bourgeoisie can no longer offer reforms, be they partial or sectional,
thus raising the general issue of power in society. This formidable
revolutionary energy cannot be a force, in the historical sense of the
word, without constituting itself as a centralised party. (Without this,
it will be wasted, possibly even turned to the counter-revolution's
advantage.) However, this movement cannot form a centralised party
unless it puts forward an entirely communist programme and gives itself
a revolutionary direction. The communist programme and direction
themselves are not the immediate result of the movement, however much
revolutionary energy it may have, but rather the result of all
accumulated prior experience, transformed into a living force, into an
organ of direction of the party and the revolution by a long and hard,
conscious and voluntary historic struggle assumed by the communist
factions.

16: The development of capitalism engenders the development of its
historic gravedigger and at the same time determines the latter's
essential conditions of struggle. This does not mean that proletarian
struggle is somehow similar or equal to that of the bourgeoisie, but
rather that it engenders the very conditions in which this struggle
develops and determines it as antagonistic to capital, making the
proletarian revolution **unique and distinct** from all those that have
gone before it.

17: It is in this way that capitalism engenders a **revolutionary**
class which is an **exploited** class at the same time, thus creating a
reality with no historical precedent. No revolutionary class in the
past, that is to say a class with its own social project, was an
exploited class at the same time.

18: Bourgeois society thus develops a particular sphere -- the
proletariat -- which is the **negation** of all particular spheres.
Capitalist society thus gives rise to a class determined to constitute
itself as such and to transform itself into the dominant class to
**abolish all classes**. Therefore, the proletariat is a being whose
full realisation lies in its own abolition. Revolutionary classes of the
past asserted themselves as a power and as a particular sphere, in order
to set up a different type of domination, in whose defence they
consolidated themselves as reactionary forces. The proletariat, on the
contrary, asserts itself as a class to eliminate all domination, all
exploitation and all states.

19: This is how the worldwide character of capitalism engenders the
proletariat as a _worldwide class_, without any regional, sectorial or
national interests to defend.

On the contrary, the bourgeoisie not only realised its revolution by
asserting its particular interests, but its own essence (competition)
permanently forces the bourgeois to oppose each other brutally and to
confront each other at all levels over the distribution of the means of
production and markets. Unity among bourgeois (limited companies,
agreements between monopolies, national states, constellations of
states, ... the world state) is always realised to ensure that
commercial war and/or class war are confronted under the best possible
conditions. This unity may explode at any moment into its various
particular fractions. That's why, however unified and generalised the
action of the bourgeoisie, it always contains division; that's why all
peace is a phase of a war to come, whilst any action of the proletariat,
however partial it may be, contains universality, that is to say:
however regionally or sectorially limited an action of this class
against capital may be, it contains the affirmation of the unique
interests of the proletariat in every part of the world and the struggle
for universal social revolution.

20: These fundamental and inseparable elements, which we only present
separately here for the sake of clarity, constitute the essence of the
proletariat's revolutionary struggle and determine the totality of the
content of its action. It is on this basis that the most determined
elements of the class organise and resolve the enormous problems that
the struggle has posed, poses and will continue to pose. It is
imperative that every tactical decision ensues from this **invariant
strategic whole**, as the indissociable unity of the totality of the
movement, of its goals and its means. Any tactic which strays from this
basis is, at best, an error made by the working class, although in the
majority of cases it is a vehicle of Capital's counter-revolutionary
politics.

21: The **communist programme** is nothing other than the whole of
practical consequences of these determinations of social antagonism and
of their development up to worldwide proletarian revolution, and the
institution of communism as a society. Nevertheless, reality precedes
human consciousness of it, which is why the formalisation of this
programme, far from being reached in a single historical moment, is the
successive result of a whole of social upheavals. Each phase of
revolution and counter-revolution (each one more profound until
worldwide revolution) allows a better understanding of the consequences
of the essential determinations of revolutionary struggle, in other
words, each phase permits theoretical clarification, in an increasingly
thorough and precise form, of the implications already practically
contained within these invariant determinations.

The rest of our account will be developed on this basis. That is to say
it will first take up the most general formulations of our programme and
then, on the basis of the necessary lessons drawn from the highest
levels of the phases of revolution and counter-revolution, will
actualise, concretise and clarify their true present and future
significance.

22: The objective of the proletariat, and thus of communists, is (as
already formulated by the League of Communists' statute 1847): "The
overthrow of the bourgeoisie, the domination of the proletariat, the
abolition of the old bourgeois society based on class antagonisms and
the institution of a new society, without class and private property".
Or, as Engels confirmed: "the programme of our party... is not only
socialist in general, but directly communist, that is to say a party
whose final goal is the suppression of all states and thus of
democracy."

23: This necessarily implies the constitution of the proletariat as a
class and thus as a worldwide party, in other words, into an organic and
centralised force, opposed to the whole existing social order.

The organisation of the proletariat as a class tends to be constantly
undermined by the competition between proletarians as free and equal
sellers of the labour force commodity. A whole of ideological, political
and military forces cements this atomisation upon which social peace and
bourgeois order are based. In such conditions, and despite the fact that
the proletariat is, in its own essence, an irreconcilable adversary and
a permanent threat to the bourgeoisie, the proletariat maintains no more
than a vague impression of its social antagonism to capitalist order.
It tends to transform itself into a political appendage of capitalist
society by its dissolution/destruction into the people. Democratic
fronts, national unity, popular fronts, fronts of national liberation,
national-socialism or social nationalism... flourish in this climate, as
do all expressions of the bourgeoisie's negation of the proletariat as a
class, which on a higher level, culminates in massacre in capitalist
war.

24: But class antagonisms inevitably start to reappear. The proletariat
emerges as a class, as a party, stronger, firmer, more decided, showing
by its very essence that its existence is only possible **by excluding
all fronts, all class alliances**. Even at the time of the so-called
bourgeois revolution, the proletariat asserted itself as a class by
trying to organise its revolutionary terror and class dictatorship. In
the face of this programme the bourgeoisie, including its most
"progressive" fractions, retreated terrified, resorting to the most
"reactionary" sectors of society to enforce the cannibalism, the terror,
of the counter-revolution together.

It is certainly true that, more than once, proletarian struggle may have
coincided in time and space with some fraction of the bourgeoisie in its
confrontation with the same enemy (struggle against the enemies of one's
enemies, as Marx called it) but only as a partial, limited and political
coincidence, given that the proletariat's social antagonism against its
own exploiters is permanent. This is why this struggle inevitably leads
the proletariat to assert itself as an autonomous force which threatens
the bourgeoisie as a whole, all its fractions taking on a single and
identical policy of counter-revolutionary terrorism.

25: Capitalism, as a worldwide system, in developing the proletariat as
a worldwide class, makes communism possible across the globe. At the
same time, it determines the programmatical aspects essential for the
extension of the revolution and the character of the organs of the
proletariat.

Communist revolution (its first insurrectional triumphs inevitably
taking place in certain parts of the world) is necessarily worldwide:
**either it spreads or it dies!**

The proletariat cannot reach its objectives at any other level, whether
at that of the factory, the region, the country or even a group of
countries. No kind of what is historically termed "workers' control",
"self-managed production" of one or all the companies in a country leads
to the destruction of the capitalist production relationship nor is it,
in any way, the path towards this destruction. Communism, as a movement,
opposes and excludes, at its origin, homeland, nation and national
struggle. The abolition of all borders and nations is inherent in its
development.

The constitution of the proletariat into a single body acting on a
worldwide level implies organic centralism. Organic centralism
guarantees the general interests of the movement against all
particularism, localism, immediatism and it also struggles against
corporatist, federalist and self-managementist ideologies which are only
of benefit to the counter-revolution. This is obviously the case for all
class organisations -- associations, formal parties, state.... -- and
during all phases of the struggle, whether the proletariat is a
dominated or dominating class.

26: _The workers have no homeland_ and one cannot take away from them
what they don't possess. Any form of defence of the nation, whatever the
pretext, is in reality an attack on the whole worldwide working class.
Under the reign of the bourgeoisie, all wars are _imperialist wars_,
with two or more opposing fractions or groups whose interests are world
capital. The proletariat wages and demands only one war: social war
against the whole bourgeoisie. Independent of the immediate intentions
of the protagonists, the essential function of wars is to assert Capital
and to objectively and subjectively smash the subversive class at the
heart of this society. Therefore, far from being "simple" wars between
national states, between the forces of "national liberation" and
"imperialist" forces or "inter-imperialist wars", they are, in their
essence, **wars of capital against communism**.

In the face of all the inter-bourgeois antagonisms between "progressive"
and "reactionary", "fascist" and "anti-fascist", "left wing" and "right
wing" fractions (the logical continuation of which is imperialist war)
the proletariat has only one possible response: intransigent struggle
for its own class interests, against all sacrifices, against every truce
and national solidarity, that is _revolutionary defeatism_, turning its
weapons against its "own" exploiters and immediate oppressors. The
proletariat's aim is to transform capitalist war into revolutionary war
against the worldwide bourgeoisie, by way of the international
centralisation of this _community of struggle_ against Capital.

27: The division of the world into three worlds -- "capitalist",
"socialist" and "under-developed or third-world" -- is a product of the
proletariat's defeat, aiming to consolidate and perpetuate this division
in order to destroy the organic unity of interests and objectives of the
international proletariat.

Even when this ideology is used "innocently" as "a simple description of
reality" it contains within it the destruction of the worldwide
proletariat because all such forms of ideology presuppose that the
proletariat should take on different tasks in each one of the "different
worlds".

Over and above what those ideologists support consistently or otherwise,
all ideologies such as the need to deepen democracy or to fight for
socialism in the "first world" alone, the need for political reforms (or
for "political revolution") in the "second world", the need for
bourgeois democratic tasks and national liberation in the "third world"
lead irrevocably to the proletariat's self-negation as an international
class and this means, in practice, that proletarians are made to
participate in various inter-fractional fights and capitalist wars, in
permanent capitalist wars for dividing up the world.

28: National liberation struggles, popular anti-imperialist wars... are
specific expressions of the ideology which uses workers as cannon fodder
in capitalist war. Imperialism is not a phenomenon particular to any one
power or state. It is an inherent and invariant phenomenon of Capital
itself: each atom of value valorising itself contains all the conditions
of imperialist terrorism. This is why all the bourgeoisie is imperialist
and, in practice, is inextricably linked with the most powerful
fractions of world capital, not only by way of its direct participation
in Limited Companies and international financial capital, but also
through thousands of implicit or explicit deals.

The proletariat leads its own fight against its exploiters in the face
of imperialist wars. In doing so it is considered indifferentist or a
saboteur, but this is only a reflection of the coherence of world
capital. The proletariat can never be indifferent to its own
exploitation, nor can it ever accept a truce with its own exploiters
under any pretext. On the contrary, the continuity and development of
this fight against all oppressors lead it to gather in action with its
class brothers over the whole planet as one single **community of
struggle** against worldwide capital, a community upon which the
international and internationalist organisation of the proletariat is
based.

29: As revealed in thesis 11, **communism**, throughout its historical
development as well as in its objective, is the **living contradiction
of democracy** (of its rights, its citizens, its organizations, ...).
The realisation of communism presupposes the elimination of all
divisions originating from commodity production, upon which democracy is
based and therefore the destruction of all democracy.

An essential lesson for the proletariat follows on from this thesis.
Whatever the stage of the struggle it is involved in, by accepting
democracy, whether as a front (e.g. as an alliance with a fraction that
is considered more "democratic", "antifascist" or "anti-imperialist"),
as part of a transient objective (e.g., the fight for democratic
rights), as a principle within its own organisation (the search for
political guarantees in elections, assemblies, majorities, congress,
...) or as a final objective ("the formation of a truly democratic
society") the proletariat does not only objectively and totally renounce
its goals and its own formation into party, the prefiguration of the
worldwide human community, but also (and inseparably) renounces its own
formation as proletariat, its interests and thus its own being.

In all these cases it denies itself as a class, reinforces its
oppressors and excludes itself (the only assertion of its being) as a
force antagonistic to existing social order by dissolving itself in the
classless world of citizens:

* In the case of the democratic front, the proletariat drowns in the
majority, in the world of the citizen, in "antifascist resistance",
contributing to the abolition of its own class autonomy and, for the
future, legitimises the "spectacle of renewal" of the face of the state.

* In the case of the fight for democratic rights the proletariat, if it
takes part, will only reinforce the weaponry of the state, of its own
enemy.

* In the case of democratic centralism, the proletariat commits suicide
by attributing a character of principle to types of organisation which
actually embody the separations between individuals (separations between
theory and practice, decision and action, legislative and executive,
individual and society) and which will disappear with them.

* Finally, the proletariat makes itself ideologically bourgeois by
considering what is really capitalist society's ideal (**pure
democracy**) to be its own objective.

30: "Workers'" democracy (that is to say: "the government of working
people") maintains all the mediations between politics and economics and
between man and society which are specific to capital. It substitutes
the cult of parliament and the freedom of atomised individuals for that
of "democratic soviets", "free unions", "sovereign general assemblies"
and the "free worker", which, from the point of view of content, are
exactly the same: in both cases the subject is not a subversive class,
with a revolutionary programme and direction, but a free individual,
whether "a worker" or not. To the bourgeois democratic version of the
a-classist myth of the citizen, the people, the Nation corresponds this
other version of workers democracy (just as a-classist and bourgeois) of
"the workers", "the proletarian masses" (defined sociologically) and the
"exploited majority". Once again, the terminology "worker" serves to
hide and to pass off democracy, the foundation stone of capitalist
society, as a workers' victory.

31: The social democratic separation between "economic struggle" and
"political struggle", "trade union struggle" and "revolutionary
struggle", "immediate struggle" and "historic struggle"... is the
already classical bourgeois method for fragmenting and liquidating
workers' struggles. A workers' organisation which adopts this false
distinction sows confusion in the proletarian ranks and thus contributes
-- whether it wants to or not -- to the maintenance of the
disorganisation and disorientation of the movement and to the alteration
of the all-encompassing substance of the class war. It is criminal to
confuse the social movement with the banner flying above the heads of
its protagonists, to confuse Capital's reformist proposals with the
affirmation of the proletariat's interests and demands. To do so means
accepting the translation of class struggle into bourgeois terms, just
as trade unionists and other social democrats have always done
throughout the history of the proletariat.

Even if a proletarian struggle starts off on the basis of still partial
denials, such as the struggle against price rises, against the extension
and/or intensification of work, against measures which leave masses of
proletarians out of work or against whatever economic or repressive
measure of the state, it is, in its content, a struggle against the rise
of exploitation itself (rate of surplus value) and against exploitation
itself, struggles that are indissociable for the proletariat as the
exploited and revolutionary class. The indissociability of struggles of
the proletariat comes out into the open when, in situations of crisis,
the most minimal economic proletarian demand implies a direct attack on
the rates of exploitation and profit for Capital, an attack on the
sacrosanct competitiveness of the national economy. Confrontation
between the capitalists associated as state and the proletariat, then
becomes inevitable.

The fact that whichever bourgeois banner flies over the movement or
whichever reform of Capital appears as the objective of the struggle, is
not just a bourgeois lie; although it sometimes _is_, above all when
proletarians receive information in one part of the world concerning
struggle in another, filtered by the mass media. If we were to accept
what was said we would have to believe that class struggle has
disappeared and that there is nothing but national, religious, racial or
democratic struggles. But the use of a bourgeois banner as the
movement's standard is also an objective force which, as a real weakness
of the movement, helps to crush it.

Failing to recognize this reality and not developing a consequent
struggle against this objective weakness of our class, is to fail to
recognise that the dominant ideology is that of the dominant class. It
is to fail to recognize that the subversive movement of this society can
only express itself for what it really is, on the basis of its vanguard
factions, which are necessarily minoritarian during the whole of the
pre-insurrectional process and, in all certainty, immediately
afterwards. Expressing itself for what it really is signifies rising up
with slogans which explicitly negate present-day society, such as for
the abolition of wage labour.

32: There also exist other social democratic dichotomies such as
"economics versus politics" and "theory versus practice" that in every
case divide up the revolutionary process in order to liquidate and
destroy its subversive unity. One particularly notable case of such a
conception is the one according to which the capitalist mode of
production is divided into periods: a period/phase which is "ascendant",
"progressive" or based on "formal domination"... and another, defined as
"decadent", "reactionary", "imperialist" or based on "real domination".

Capital's own development is always its greatest reform, its constant
transformations and its necessary quantitative as well as qualitative
changes (value must permanently valorise itself) are marked, not by two
antinomic phases (ascendance/decadence) but by a succession of levels
(the only basis for a periodisation of capitalism) in which all
contradictions (the most basic of which is valorisation/devalorisation)
appear in an increasingly exacerbated form each time.

All theories of decadence destroy the universality of the capitalist
mode of production (in time and/or in space). They lead inevitably to
the liquidation of the invariance of the interests and needs of the
revolutionary proletariat, thus ultimately negating the one and only
gravedigger of the old world, the active agent in the catastrophic fall
of the system. These theories lead the decadentists inescapably into the
arms of immediatism, gradualism, evolutionism, fatalism ... deadly traps
for classist militancy. All the decadentist theories (quite apart from
the fact that they are no more than simple economic, that is to say
bourgeois, theories) lead to this result, whatever the type of argument
used.

The reformist practices inferred by all the decadentist theories are
also expressed systematically justifying/demanding a posteriori the
whole counter-revolutionary practice of social democracy (thus as an
historic totality that also includes official anarchism). This is
realised by way of the fallacious pretext that during the so-called
"ascendant" period, the proletariat would not have had communism as its
objective, but rather the struggle for reforms (essentially bourgeois
struggle), for its integration as an economic object in the system
("class" for capital).

All theories of decadence are based on the idea that the bourgeoisie has
of itself: that of progress, evolution, civilisation, ... as if they
could be neutral and a-classist, as if progress under the bourgeoisie
could be something other than bourgeois progress (the greatest bourgeois
progress is always bourgeois war!), as if evolution under the
bourgeoisie could be anything other than the evolution of bourgeois
exploitation. The decadentists see progress, evolution and civilisation
developing up to a certain date (and, for the most consistent, in
certain geo-political areas) and then reaching a fateful watershed,
justified in various ways depending on the school involved (Stalinist,
Trotskyist, Luxemburgist or whatever), after which it begins to decline,
to "objectively" collapse. All this will inevitably be accompanied by
"moral", artistic, ... decadence (something which all these currents
have in common with the numerous religious and fascistoid sects). All
this is just counter-revolutionary ideology that the proletariat in
struggle will destroy.

33: Social democratic dualism and the ideology of decadence which denies
Capital as an organic totality inevitably leads to the ideological
creation of an ensemble of categories into which the heirs of social
democracy imagine the world to be divided. However, these ideological
categories, in so far as they have become dominant conceptions, have
become powerful weapons for dividing the proletariat. Thus, added to the
most classic bourgeois forms of categorising and dividing into
countries, such as the division of the world into three as we have
already mentioned, or the division of countries into "developed" and
"under-developed", "central" and "Third World", are other more subtle
divisions, which fulfil the same function -- to sow confusion as to the
unified nature of world capital, to disperse and disorganise the
proletariat by presenting it with different projects or objectives
according to region. In this regard, the ideology of "state capitalism"
is particularly pernicious. According to this ideology there exists, in
the "best" cases, different types of capitalism and in the "worst", kind
of half-and-half societies, "neither truly capitalist nor truly
socialist", in which "state capitalism" becomes a phase in the
revolution. All these ideologies, which constitute distinct varieties of
Kautskyism, Leninism, etc. are nothing other than the old
Stalino-Trotskyist myth of "Russian specificity" generalised to the
whole world. Their central objective is the negation, camouflage and
covering up of the real antagonism between the world capitalist state
and the internationalist proletariat.

34: The force of counter-revolution bases itself today on the
exploitation of all the weaknesses of the great international
revolutionary wave of the years 1917-1923, made possible by the
political and organisational destruction of the communist factions who
began to draw up a balance sheet of this period.

The counter-revolution erected the myth of the "workers' state in one
country" over the dead body of the revolutionary proletariat (the myth
of "socialism in one country" is merely its right-wing variant), which
served to use millions of proletarians as cannon fodder in capitalist
war. This so-called "Workers' State", just like all the others which
adopted this or other similar denominations (Eastern Europe, Cuba,
China, Angola, Vietnam, Algeria, Mozambique, Nicaragua...), is no more
nor less than a capitalist state whose ideology has expressly usurped
some Marxist phrases to better hide its bourgeois character. The whole
planet is capitalist. **The communist revolution will be worldwide or
it will not be.**

35: All currents which support, be it in a "critical" way or not, any
state or government existing in the world today (Stalinist, Trotskyist,
Maoist, Third-Worldist, "anarchist"...) are nothing other than
reactualised forms of bourgeois socialism, born from the womb of social
democracy as an historic force. In practice, in addition to supporting
the apparatuses of the bourgeois state (governments, unions,
parliaments...) and contributing to capitalist wars, these forces are
decisive in the transformation of proletarian needs into capital's
reforms. This inevitably leads them to always act as the shock troops of
capital for maintaining bourgeois order.

36: From Proudhon to Kautsky, from Hitler to Castro, from Stalin to
Mussolini, from Bernstein to Peron, from Mao to Khomeini, from Arafat to
Gorbachev ... and other reformers there have always existed progressist
bourgeois fractions, partisans of great reforms, of populist discourse,
workerists, "against the rich", "against monopolies", "against
oligarchy", "against the few families who own the country", "against
plutocracy"... in favour of "social" institutions. These fractions
correspond to the permanent historic tendency of capital to self-reform
and to constantly revolutionise its productive base and social structure
while maintaining, of course, the essential: wage labour, exploitation
of man by man. Their specific function is to present themselves as
alternatives to the classic forms of domination (a decisive function for
polarising society into two bourgeois poles), to present reforms as the
objective of all struggle and, in the inter-capitalist struggle, to
appear as the radicalising sectors of society. Their relative
importance, according to the epoch or the country, stems from the
credibility that they have in the eyes of proletarians, that is to say
from their capacity to control the workers and to wipe out all class
autonomy by means of reforms (or by the promise of reforms) aiming to
render wage slavery less visible and real poverty more "viable" and
which, in fact, consolidate the social dictatorship of Capital. Whatever
its brand of reformism, the bourgeoisie is the irreconcilable enemy of
the proletariat and, whatever its rhetoric, all its fractions
systematically resort to open terror against the proletariat -- not just
the privilege of the Right or of the fascists -- whenever the
preservation of the system demands it. In the face of these fractions,
the programme of the proletariat does not change one iota: the
proletariat is obliged to organise itself as a force to crush and
liquidate all types of critical support for reform, along with all the
other fractions.

37: The objective of the bourgeois state, the democratic state, is to
keep the proletariat disorganised, denied as a class or, better still,
contained and mobilised in the service of the bourgeoisie. What is
essential to all democratic mechanisms is the destruction of the organic
unity of the proletariat, its interests and its "organisation" into
partial "interests" which correspond to the individual, the citizen
(homo economicus), buyer and seller of commodities. Unions are vital
organs of the bourgeois state which fulfil this function. In effect,
they represent the "world of work" within Capital, that is to say the
proletariat liquidated as a class, divided into sectors, negotiating
(like any other individual in mercantile society) the selling price of
their commodity -- labour power -- which, in turn, assures a
"reasonable" rate of profit and guarantees social peace. In the face of
this type of organisation, the proletariat struggles **to organise
itself outside and against the unions** which, as obstacles to communist
revolution, must be completely destroyed. This is why all ideologies
which recommend reform of the unions, their reconquest or working within
them (even if they say they are doing so to destroy them) sow the seeds
of confusion. They keep proletarians, who intuitively sense the
reactionary role of the unions, trapped in these organs of the state
(which also happens to help improve their credibility). They serve
reaction. The fact that, in numerous cases, we find real workers'
organisations at the origins of these organisations merely confirms the
capacity of the bourgeoisie to recuperate organisational forms created
by the proletariat and to use them for its own ends.

The "trade union issue" is not a question of denomination, but rather of
social practice. The real antagonism is not, as some would have us
believe, between economic and political interests nor between immediate
and historical interests, because the unions, as state apparatuses, do
not even defend the "economic" and "immediate" interests of the workers
(which, as we have already said, are inseparable from the revolutionary
affirmation of the proletariat). The real antagonism is between workers'
associationism, the organic reconstitution of the struggle, the
interests of the proletariat and the apparatus of the democratic state
for mercantile negotiations. This is the case, whatever they call
themselves. In the same way, if the denomination "union" came to
globally and solely refer to these state apparatuses (which would make
it rather unlikely that real class associations would give themselves
this name) other more radical denominations (workers' councils,
soviets...) could also be used to hide state apparatuses outside and
against which workers' associationism will also necessarily develop.

37a: The revolution is not a question of organisational form. On the
contrary, the problem is its **real social content** and, ultimately,
concerns either organs of workers' struggle against Capital or organs of
the bourgeois state for the destruction of the revolutionary force. In
the case of the latter, the name or ideological cover adopted to better
assure their counter-revolutionary function does not change their
bourgeois character at all.

It is obvious, however, that in the real process of growing workers'
associationism the proletariat is developing more and more global forms
of organisation, corresponding to its own development as a class. Thus,
for example, forms still marked by corporatism and sectional aspects
will be surpassed by the organisation of struggle on the basis of places
of work and by branches of production. In turn these forms will be
surpassed by territorial organisations in which the whole of the
proletariat (unemployed and workers, young and old...) can participate
and centralise themselves. This will represent a decisive spring-board,
the proletariat giving itself international forms which will fight
against the respective nations that the bourgeoisie uses to divide its
historic enemy. This process, within which different forms of workers'
associationism succeed one another according to their different levels
of consciousness and confrontation with Capital, is not a linear and
gradual process. On the contrary, it is a process marked by qualitative
jumps, advances and also setbacks... whose totality is determined by the
balance of forces between proletariat and bourgeoisie.

Workers' councils, soviets, industrial pickets, class organisations
organised on the level of a country, etc. are all forms corresponding to
this real process of development of the proletariat, going beyond the
divisions imposed by Capital, above all by surpassing the struggle for
categories or workplace (although councils, soviets, combinations, etc.
could still be based on association by category). This process
corresponds to epochs of open social and political crisis, in which the
proletariat can no longer believe in partial and particular solutions.

However, even in the midst of this process of associationism, it is
never the forms in themselves which can guarantee (as the councilists
believe) the interests of the proletariat (nor any other type of formal
guarantee that the apologists of workers' democracy would like to
establish, such as sovereign assemblies, elected delegates, revocable at
any moment...). Within the real process of organisation of the
proletariat as a force everything will depend on the real practice of
these organisations and, therefore, on their effective _leadership_.
What is decisive is the class struggle on the inside of such
organisations, in which counter-revolution will continue to be present
and organised, acting to transform such associations into organs of the
bourgeois state. The sole guarantee against this is the decisive action
of vanguard factions of the proletariat who will not submit to any of
the democratic mechanisms which the counter-revolution tries to impose.
With all their strength, organised communists oppose any ideology
tending to dissolve this genuine leadership of the proletariat in
formation into the midst of the whole of the workers in struggle (or
worse still, in the whole of workers as a sociological category). They
will not accept, under any pretext, the discipline of these mass
organisations which contradict every element of the historical programme
of the proletariat. By all means and to the bitter end, they will lead
the struggle against any attempt to give these organisations a
counter-revolutionary leadership to impose a genuine revolutionary
leadership on the movement.

38: Parliament and elections are the particular forms in which democracy
is concretised. They express the same bourgeois need to dilute the
proletariat into the mass of citizens, to practically deny the existence
of a class which is antagonistic to the whole of the established order,
thus reaffirming its own domination. Their specific function is to
divert workers from their everyday struggles against Capital and to
develop and reproduce the illusion of a peaceful change in the
proletariat's situation just by virtue of the ballot box (the highest
expression of which is of a peaceful passage to socialism). Elections
serve to distinguish between the different fractions and representatives
of the bourgeoisie, those which are directly charged with taking the top
position in the executive and directing the repression against
proletarian struggles. Parliamentarianism and electoralism inevitably
turn their back on the methods and objectives of the workers' struggle
and cannot, in any form, be used by proletarians in struggle. Adding the
qualifier "revolutionary" to parliamentarianism and claiming to use it
to denounce bourgeois domination only (as has been shown historically)
serves to increase confusion in the proletarian ranks. In fact it
constitutes a powerful element for liquidating (through its legalism,
leadership politics, cult of personality) all activity aiming to
constitute the party of the class and it only serves the
counter-revolution.

The only proletarian response to the regular unleashing of these
bourgeois attacks known as elections is the rejection of any electoral
truce, the pursuit of struggle for exclusively proletarian interests,
the denunciation of elections and, wherever possible (as determined by
the balance of class forces) sabotage by direct action.

39: Racial oppression, sexual oppression, the destruction of the
environment... are inherent to all class societies, but no other society
has attained a level of atrocity as gigantic and as systematic as under
the reign of capitalism and more particularly, under the dictatorship of
the progress of capitalist civilisation, in its current development.
Only a global struggle can destroy the real basis of the alienation --
estrangement -- of Man and all the inhuman manifestations and atrocities
proper to capitalist social relations. Only one social class -- the
proletariat -- contains in its being this project and its realisation,
the communist revolution.

Contrary to this project, the liquidation of the struggle by way of its
fragmentation and the creation of specific movements (feminism,
anti-racism, environmentalism) tend to reduce and to resolve each of
these problems into a separate sphere, thus preventing any attack on
their profound and common cause. They are therefore irremediable
additional attempts to adapt, ameliorate and repair (plaster over) the
system and, by these means, to reinforce the dictatorship of Capital.
Practically, these types of movement have served and can only serve to
divert the revolutionary energy of the proletariat, to improve the
mechanisms of domination and oppression as well as to increase the rate
of exploitation of the proletariat.

39a: For the first time, the universal exploitation of a class
containing all races and every possible racial mix and combination,
gives the concept of **the human species** the whole of its meaning and
validity. The only human and definitive solution to racial oppression
and racism lies within this universal exploitation, within the unique
interests of the proletariat and within the struggle it is forced to
develop to impose its universal social revolution. On the other side of
the barricades are the exploiters, the defenders and representatives of
the system of social production which, although they themselves are of
every colour, act in a unified way through the racist/antiracist
discourse.

This said, **racism** (and/or **antiracism**) is more than just an
ideological problem. The fact that Capital buys the labour power of one
race for less than another's, the fact that the conditions of
exploitation and the living conditions of one part of the proletariat
are worse than another's, reflect that in Capital's reality a human
being's production, as a wage slave, is of absolutely no interest as a
human being, but is solely determined (as with all other commodities) by
the amount of social labour incorporated into him. This racist reality
of Capital determines that, in the same way that the value of labour
power of a qualified worker is greater than that of an ordinary worker,
the value of the labour power of a "native" worker, for example, is
greater than that of an "immigrant" worker (presupposing that the former
contains more work of integration, socialisation, nationalisation and
unionisation than the other).

In the international organisation of worldwide bourgeois domination,
racism is only able to present itself very marginally compared to what
it really is (overtly racist speeches by one or other government or
bourgeois party are relatively rare). In most cases racism develops on
the basis of antiracism. Antiracism thus constitutes an ideological
force which is becoming more and more decisive in the reproduction of
exploitation and of this racist society.

Any struggle against the racism of this society which fails to attack
capitalist society (that is to say the foundations of racism), any
struggle which, therefore, is not a struggle of the international
proletariat against the worldwide bourgeoisie transforms itself into an
additional ideological element of the state and of bourgeois oppression.
The most advanced expression of this antiracism could be found in the
triumphant bourgeoisie of the so-called Second World War and still
constitutes a decisive ideological element of all current great world
powers. Antiracism is thus the most refined form of reproduction of
racist society: the state of Israel was constituted on the basis of a
fictional community of Jewish antiracist struggle and is a particularly
illustrative example of how antiracism serves racist capitalist
exploitation to take on its maximal expression in the exploitation camps
of the proletariat of that region.

39b: The division of labour by sex (or age) is an objective element of
the capitalist division of the proletariat which will only be abolished
through the liquidation of Capital and the auto-suppression of the
proletariat. Men, women, young, old... all proletarians, reproduce their
lives as labour power of Capital, for Capital. The direct production of
surplus value in Capital's centres of labour (factories, mines, fields,
offices, ...) cannot be guaranteed if labour power is not itself
produced. Capital, inheritor of the patriarchal society, has developed
this labour power and whenever it has needed to it has used and still
uses men and women of all ages for the direct production of surplus
value. However, it has particularly condemned **proletarian women** to
be the principal agent of domestic production of labour power
(production which is part of the global production of the labour power
commodity).

Even if Capital, when it buys labour power, pays for the whole value of
this commodity, that is to say all the work necessary for its production
(domestic, educational, repressive, etc.) the one who receives the wage
is the direct producer of surplus value and not the one who carries out
this domestic labour.

This element, in addition to others, constitutes a decisive factor in
the particular submission and oppression of **proletarian women** by
Capital.

**Feminism** is the bourgeois response to this particular situation. Its
starting point is to turn anything particular to the exploitation of the
proletarian woman by _Capital_ into the global condition of Woman in
general. It thus transforms the proletarian revolt of men and women into
an interclassist movement whose rallying cry is that "men in general
exploit women in general". In addition to feminism's global
counter-revolutionary work as a force of fragmentation, of diversion and
of concealment of the real contradictions and solutions of the struggle
of classes, feminism has also been a decisive instrument of Capital for
gearing up proletarian exploitation. Thanks to equal rights, feminism
now leads the proletarian woman to take on a more active role in the
direct production of surplus value and to participate, side by side with
men, each time more directly, in imperialist war. From the struggle for
work for women to the demand for the right to vote via all the campaigns
for women's participation in the active life of the nation, feminism has
always been a force asserting Capital against the proletariat, a force
whose greatest achievements are female cops, the massive incorporation
of women into patriotic armies (a necessity for Capital in order to make
the whole of the civil population participate more and more directly in
its war), female MPs, generals, Prime Ministers...

39c: The **fragmenting ideologies of world capitalism** such as
antiracism or feminism aim to prevent the unification of the
international proletariat. The importance of these ideologies can only
be understood by taking into account that each one of these movements of
pro-state mobilisation tries to suck in the majority of the planet's
proletarian population so as to divert it from its class and
revolutionary objectives. The most radical feminists never forget to
mention that their demands concern women, who make up the majority on
the planet. Radical antiracism has the same pretensions: the proletarian
whose dark skin or characterisation as an immigrant or as the son of
immigrants determines particularly atrocious forms of exploitation by
capital, represents by far the great majority of the world proletariat.
Here also we see the importance of the revolutionary critique of such
ideologies which will be swept away by the unifying struggle of the
proletariat of all colours, of both sexes, of all ages, from all over
the world and from all sides... against world capital. It is in this
**community of real struggle** today and in its development that racism
and antiracism are being destroyed and will be destroyed. It is the same
for the so-called "woman question" and feminism, etc.

39d: Capitalist development with its consequent **tyranny** of the rate
of profit **against the environment** necessary for human life has
attained such levels that not only are ever-growing parts of humanity
subjected to permanent hunger caused by desertification (or all other
causes also "naturally" produced by the valorisation of capital) but
also the permanence itself of the present civilisation has become
incompatible with life on earth in the medium term. This is occurring
through the capitalist destruction of the atmosphere and of sources of
drinking water... without even mentioning other "small details" such as
the potential for generalised nuclear destruction, universal air and
water pollution (the increasing accumulation of heavy metals such as
lead and mercury in the environment, the destruction of the ozone layer
indispensable for life, the accumulation of CO2 causing the greenhouse
effect, the melting of ice caps and therefore the risk of flooding of
inhabited land etc.), more and more frequent industrial, chemical and
nuclear "accidents", with more and more serious consequences, total
inviability, in the fullest sense of the term, in that life will be
impossible in the major urban centres of the planet.

The proletarian communist revolution constitutes the only valid
alternative to the barbarism of existing civilisation, in so far as it
can liquidate the basis of generalised contamination and the causes of
the destruction of all the environments necessary to the real human life
of the species.

The **environmental** movement is the bourgeois answer to the
generalised degradation of all the conditions of life. Be it
parliamentarianist or anti-parliamentarianist, openly or secretly
reformist, environmentalism attacks the consequences and not the
foundations of generalised contamination. Its most important social
function is to divert the struggle waged by the proletariat against the
brutal worsening of all conditions of reproduction of its life.
Consciously or not, the proletariat attacks the basis of the whole
society (the rate of exploitation, the rate of profit, the
competitiveness of companies, the economy, ...). Environmentalists aim
to transform this into a mere struggle against the excesses of a system
whose basis they defend.

Organised environmentalists, with their return to nature, their
proposals for purification stations, for state control of contamination,
etc. not only defend the general basis of the generalised commodity
system (the source of all contamination) but also irremediably give
their support to austerity campaigns led by the state against the
proletariat. As if the proletariat wasn't impoverished enough,
environmentalists propose more austerity, to be more "natural": they are
the best commercial agents of the sale of "nature" and put forward
programmes of austerity and increased exploitation to the proletariat
that no other sector of the bourgeoisie would dare to promote. For the
environmentalists it would be better if it were possible to feed the
proletariat on grass instead of meat. Basing themselves on the huge myth
that this society is a society of consumption (while in reality it is
determined by the production of value), the environmentalists are the
most cynical defenders of austerity, of belt tightening.

In an epoch in which the devastating effects of commodity production
leads to an ever-increasing mortality from desertification, at a time in
which capitalist development engenders irremediable physical
malformations and ever more numerous and incurable illnesses due to
atmospheric contamination, the revolt of the proletariat against the
system continues and in its development will face environmentalists of
all kinds, further obstacles that will have to be swept away to impose
revolution.

39e: Capital only reproduces proletarian humanity in so far as it is an
instrument of work and a source of valorisation. The "factories" where
the proletariat reproduces itself as proletarians, in which the species
reproduces itself as simple labour power for Capital are the **family,
schools, hospitals, churches**, institutions of **social security,
prisons**, etc. All these institutions are, from top to bottom,
determined by the reproduction not of human beings but of wage slavery.
They will be abolished by the communist revolution along with the
society from which they emerged.

Faced with the impossibility of denying the obvious antagonism between
social revolution and the reproduction of all institutions reproducing
private property and the society of Capital, the classical approach of
revisionism, social democracy, is to recognize in its maximum programme
for after the revolution the existence of this antagonism in a
camouflaged form. In doing so it sabotages all practical and concrete
struggle against those institutions even to the point of being
sufficiently insolent to go as far as defending the existence of the
"proletarian family" or schools purified of all excesses... under full
socialism! However, all real struggles by the proletariat have
_confronted_ these institutions and, in various forms, have fought
**against** them. In all deep proletarian revolts an irreconcilable
opposition appears not only to institutions such as churches and
prisons, but also to the family and schools, etc. The essence of all
these institutions (family and schools included) is the reproduction of
private property and the state, whose very structure reproduces the
individual producer of surplus value, the "prole" as familial property,
reproduces sex or age based division of labour necessary for the
reproduction of Capital's labour forces and reproduces the discipline
necessary to maintain wage exploitation, etc.

The struggle against the family, school, just as the struggle against
prisons, churches, social service institutions or any other type of
capitalist institution is a fundamental struggle which is inseparable
from all communist struggle against this society. Just as one cannot put
a problem as important as trade unionism to one side until after the
insurrection (given that we are confronted by it in every major
struggle), it is counter-revolutionary to postpone the struggle against
schools, the family, etc. until after the insurrection.

39f: Only the proletarian struggle can take up this type of struggle. It
is only within the **real community of struggle** that proletarians can
forge the bases of the destruction, of the communist critique of the
family, school and assert their own project. Any search for positive
alternatives within capitalist society falls inevitably into reformism
and bourgeois socialism because the real alternative to all these social
structures can only arise from this developing negation, that is to say
from the assertion of communism as a general movement of **negation of
the whole of existing society**.

In this negation in action, it is clear that communists develop this
concrete negation of the family, school, etc, with all their forces but
cannot, for one moment, have any illusions that they will abolish those
institutions without abolishing the real private property from which
they emerged. Communists have the advantage over other proletarians of a
global vision of the movement and its goals and of situating themselves,
in all practical aspects of the struggle, at the head of the
proletariat.

In the same way that feminism is the bourgeois response to the "woman
question", antiracism the bourgeois response to the racial question and
environmentalism the bourgeois response to the question of the
destruction of the conditions of human life, there is a whole complex
collection of bourgeois responses to the issues of the family and
school. Amongst these, we could mention the ideologies of the
alternative family, of living communities, "free love", the revolution
of everyday life, "free" or alternative schools, etc. It is not only a
question of the simple fragmentation of proletarian struggle, as in the
other cases, but of its effective liquidation on the basis of a whole of
reformist projects and ideologies which all have the reform and the
reproduction of life necessary to maintain wage labour in common.

Only the constitution of the proletariat as a class and therefore a
party, as a human community opposed to all established order, contains
the negation of the family, of school, of paternalism and of the
privatisation of relations in its embryo, in its development and in the
human relations which are forged in the common struggle. The effective
development of this negation will find an obstacle in all reformist
projects concerning school and family which must be destroyed in order
to impose its revolution to abolish them forever, in the same process as
the abolition of private property.

40: Work is the living negation of human activity, life, satisfaction
and enjoyment. Work makes man a stranger to himself, to what he
produces, to his own activity and to the human species. Work is nothing
other than human activity imprisoned in the framework of class societies
and the concretisation of the necessity for the dominant classes to
appropriate surplus production by exploiting and crushing the other
classes. Capitalism, in liberating (in separating) the exploited from
their means of life and production and in destroying old forms of
production, has imposed wage labour and generalised free work on the
whole of the planet. It has thus reduced man, everywhere, to the
condition of labourer, a tortured person ("travail" is derived
etymologically from the Latin "traepalium" meaning "instrument of
torture").

In work, the proletariat is universally dispossessed of its product,
estranged, lost to itself, denied its essence, its life and its
enjoyment and rendered a stranger to the product of its own activity.

As well as pouring its sweat, its blood, its life into an activity in
which absurdity competes with stupefaction, it is separated from all
immediate links with other people as human beings and is thus separated
from its own generic life, from the human species.

It is only in the struggle **against work**, against the activity that
they are forced to carry out and against those who make them do it, in
the generalisation of this struggle and the consequent calling into
question of the totality of society that proletarians reemerge as human
beings and take the first steps towards a **communist society** where
the activity of people will finally become **human, for the human
being**.

40a: Capital has made work the most important activity to which everyone
is subordinated, man's essential activity. (We are not considered for
who we are but for "what we do in life", which in this society means
"profession", "job"). It thus couldn't be more coherent that all the
ideologies of bourgeois society make work **the essence of the human
being** and that this ideology is reproduced and supported by the
hundreds of millions of citizens who waste their lives every day to
"make a living".

Consistent with this, all the ideologies of Capital are based on
**sacrifice, renunciation**, the internalisation of emotions, feelings,
sensations... To work corresponds sacrifice, and to sacrifice, religion
(including the Marxist-Leninist religion of the state!) as justification
for the repression of every manifestation of passions and human,
physical and bodily enjoyment.

From the apologies of the left and miserabilists of the poor proletarian
to the dogmas of priests of every kind, they all offer us "the
afterlife", "the society to come" and death as the recompense and place
of realisation for men who, in the "present life", must live in
sacrifice, renounce all enjoyment and repress all pleasure.

41: Under Capital, everything that is vital must be sacrificed and life
is nothing but a sacrifice. The human being has been separated from its
**body**, its pleasure, its sex, its **vital energy**.

Flesh and blood has been permeated by centuries and centuries of what is
called civilisation.

Work, the police, the family, religion, school, television, prison,
psychiatric hospitals, in short, the state, are much more than just the
context in which that which pretends to be human is reproduced,
deformed, dehumanised. They also _shape_ (and are _part of_) _these
bodies_ which are repressed, separated, in confrontation with each
other. Under Capital, human beings are incapable of loving the human
being, are transformed into enemies of each other, even to the point of
repressing their own humanity, their own drives, their own energy.

In commodity society people only relate to each other through the
mediation of things and as private owners of things. **Universally
alienated sexuality and generalised orgasmic impotence** are the
palpable concrete expression of the absence of truly human relations, as
bodies, as totality.

Human beings do not live their sexuality directly through their life and
their energy, but rather through all those embodied mediations of things
and their spectacular images imposed by society. Better put, they make
these mediations the body's weapons and armour, so that humans become no
more than wolves for each other.

Bourgeois society itself has developed its response to this castration
inherent to being a citizen, to this repression which permanently
destroys vital energy. It consists of making a commodity out of
everything which is sexual -- they sell women, men, children, they sell
images of pleasure, penises, vaginas, women and men made of rubber.

During every revolutionary emergence of the proletariat, at the same
time as calling into question and shaking the entire edifice of the
bourgeois state, all human relations start to revolutionise themselves
and a real practical critique of generalised anti-pleasure (the
anti-pleasure so indispensable to the functioning of this society)
begins. Conversely, individualism and anti-pleasure return to make
themselves omnipresent in every triumphant counter-revolution or phase
of descendant revolution.

As with any other central aspect of the communist revolution, the
central enemy of the revolution is reformism, all the small reparations
made so that the essential can continue as it is. Thus, the ideologies
of free love, of freedom of sexual exchange, of the realisation of
pleasure in the midst of capitalist society, even when used as more than
just simple methods of propaganda to sell an object or a service...
have as their central objective the canalisation, diversion and
destruction of the revolutionary energy of the proletariat.

Truly human enjoyment has nothing to do with such mercantile
caricatures.

**Communism**, in its historical affirmation, will free all potential
for **enjoyment in the human species** and, by destroying all slavery,
will bring about a society in which physical and sexual pleasure, bodily
and orgasmic pleasure will develop **human relations, the humanity of
the human being**, the **human** species itself to levels that are
unimaginable today.

42: The development of exchange has brought about fractures and
separations of greater and greater importance in human activity and,
consequently, has brought each aspect of this activity into the grip of
the more and more omnipotent Law of Value. Capital has perfected this
process by subsuming every area of human praxis and by appropriating and
deviating all of man's creative activity towards the realisation of its
own needs of accumulation. By definitively separating creativity from
the rest of human activity it defines **Art** as the only field for
expression and creation, as the place and moment of all possible
meaning, precisely because life itself has lost all meaning. Art serves
as an outlet, as a ghetto, as an open wound of the capitalist system
where its putrefaction can fester. Capital encourages any writing,
speaking and drawing as long as these artistic products remain in the
domain of **representation** of what is lived, of the spectacle, without
ever breaking through the barriers towards the **transformation** of
life. Within these limits, these products are no more than commodities
like any other.

Popular art, anarcho art, "proletarian" art and its "worker"
miserabilism... are merely different reformist and democratic proposals
which aim to sublimate the most spectacular aspects of the misery of the
proletarian condition by failing to see and to show anything but misery
in misery, in an attempt to keep the proletariat happy in its condition
of exploited class.

Contrary to what all radical reformists defend, the alienation of art
does not reside in the fact that art makes an abstraction of misery
(given that leftist artists fill this void!) but rather in the fact that
it is **creativity alienated, the alienation of all creativity**,
element of the bourgeois state which reinforces and reproduces
capitalist society.

The communist revolution will destroy Art (including "proletarian" art)
as a product of class societies, as an activity of human beings that is
fragmented and divided under Capital. The communist revolution will
realise the creative aspirations of Man, which art pretends to respond
to in an alienated form.

This proletarian destruction of Art and, more globally, of the
partitioning of different activities under Capital, can be found even
today (and it's an old workers' tradition!) in embryonic form in the
inventive sabotage of means of bourgeois domination and terror, in the
sabotage of machines, in the turning around of their weapons, in the
methods developed for escaping from or outwitting state control, in
using the bosses' equipment for our own purposes, in absenteeism... and
more generally in all the imagination and creativity shown by our class
in its struggle to subvert this world.

Generalised insurrection will be a profoundly creative act, "artistic"
even, and a crucial step in the **revolutionary destruction of Art**.

43: The proletariat is the bearer of a society which is classless and
without the violence inherent to class societies. The society from which
it emerges is based on bourgeois terrorism, independent of the more or
less open form, with which the bourgeoisie exercises its dictatorship.
The cannibalism of the counter-revolution, the state or "para-state"
white terror obliges (and determines) the proletariat to respond to this
terror by means of **revolutionary violence**, by **red terror**.

The **organisation** of this violence which surges forward spontaneously
from the very soil of this terrorist society and the decisions regarding
its application, are decisive elements for preventing generalised
slaughter, for diminishing and shortening the birth pains of the new
society. This is why communists are not only not opposed to this
violence but, on the contrary, place themselves at its head in order to
**lead it**. Pacifism (and anti-terrorism in general), as well as the
social-democratic distinction between the violence of the working class
"as a whole" and violent "individual" actions or between "violence" and
"terrorism", have never been -- and can never be -- anything other than
a cynical manifestation of counter-revolutionary ideology.

43a: However, if it is true that the general condemnation of terrorism
or of workers' violence (necessarily minoritarian in its early stages)
is the general practice of reformism and of counter-revolution, to
deduce from this that violence or armed action is in itself
revolutionary is an ideological absurdity whose principal objective is
to contain and liquidate the combative sectors of the proletariat by
making them serve a reformist and bourgeois project. It is a moral point
of view to consider that armed struggle contains in itself either
revolutionary virtues or "human perversion", that terror is
intrinsically good or bad, independent of the **class programme** that
it develops and independent of the social project carried by this class,
which is what will inevitably determine the **form** and the **real
content** of this violence. It is the point of view of priests,
idealists and voluntarists of all types, diametrically opposed to the
materialist conception of history and constitutes an obstacle to
revolutionary practice. It is certain that the social revolution will be
necessarily violent but it is completely wrong to pretend that violence
necessarily leads to revolution. Reform and revolution are not
distinguished by whether or not they use violence, but rather by the
global social practice in the service of or against the reformed
reproduction of the system. The bourgeoisie also uses armed struggle in
its war. Opposition fractions, reformists, nationalists of all kinds...
have always resorted to violence and to armed struggle to defend their
own interests in occupying or participating in the leadership of the
state, to change its form, to impose some variation in the form or type
of capitalist accumulation that will guarantee them a greater part of
the increase in surplus value... Well armed though they may be,
"revolutionary" as their leaders may claim they are... these struggles
are nothing to do with affirming revolution against reform. On the
contrary, they are the **affirmation of reform and capitalist war
against the proletariat and the revolution**.

43b: From the proletarian point of view it is as absurd to try to
socially characterise a struggle by its use of arms as it is to
characterise it by its diffusion of texts and leaflets or whether or not
its protagonists hold meetings or edit periodicals. Yet this confusion
exists at the heart of the proletariat and plays an important role every
time the proletariat reappears on the historical scene. The
proletariat's rejection of reformism and pacifism is not crystallised in
a real revolutionary direction and thus tends to assimilate all that is
armed and violent to that which is revolutionary. This is then exploited
by reformism (armed or not). As long as **the proletariat and its
vanguard** are unable to achieve the centralisation of their force and
to develop their action, their perspective, their **insurrectionary
solution to the military question**, this type of confusion and this
exploitation will remain possible.

Moreover, given the heterogeneity of the conditions of exploitation, of
struggle, of consciousness... given the enormous organic and theoretical
ruptures that the proletariat has known in its own history (ruptures
produced by uninterrupted decades of triumphant counter-revolution), and
given the action of Capital which looks to attack and defeat the
proletariat bit by bit, it is clear that during periods of proletarian
affirmation it is extremely heterogeneous and discordant minorities,
carrying enormous ideological weaknesses which, in spite of all
weaknesses, assume a whole ensemble of violent actions and trace the
perspectives of development and extension of the future proletarian
struggle. In the face of this, state apparatuses and armed reformist
groups (whether manipulated or not) exploit the lack of centralisation,
leadership and ideological weaknesses present within these minorities,
looking (and in many cases succeeding) to separate them from the
proletariat by imposing a war of "apparatus against apparatus".
Ideologies typical of militarism (like the myth of "exemplary" action,
the cult of "violence in itself", of the "invulnerability of
conspirators as opposed to the vulnerability of the masses", "armed
propaganda") separate these minorities from the proletariat, its
interests and its struggles. They lead to the containment of these
minorities in and by capitalist war, on the basis of conceptions (such
as "prolonged people's war") which are evidently the total and complete
renunciation of the insurrectional programme of the proletariat.

43c: This liquidation of proletarian minorities, this utilisation and
diversion of energy surging from capitalist society's catastrophic
decomposition, in the benefit of the maintenance of Capital and its
local wars, transforms the proletariat into the cannon fodder of
reformism of all types or into passive spectators, the public opinion of
a war of apparatus against apparatus. All this is rendered possible by
the historical period of counter-revolution, by the non-existence of a
centralised leadership based on the whole communist experience and
programme and which concentrates and centralises these reemergent
forces, these proletarian minorities, against the whole of Capital.

With the development of crisis, and despite its tactical interest in
defeating the proletariat section by section, Capital is obliged to
homogenise its policies (there is only one crisis policy: increasing the
rate of exploitation and completely repressing all those who resist) and
this produces objective conditions of international homogenisation of
the workers' response. This situation is a necessary and indispensable
condition but not sufficient for its triumph.

To triumph, this proletarian force must be centralised, it must equip
itself with a **leadership** which can practically and adequately
**combine** the **arms of criticism with the critique of arms**, which
confronts pacifism on all terrains and reformism in all its forms. This
leadership will thus build itself, not only against pacifism and
anti-terrorism in general, but also against reformism in all its forms
and particularly against armed reformism, given that as a very "radical"
alternative it is specifically charged with recuperating and liquidating
the most radical proletarians who are breaking from the parties and
forces which traditionally control them.

44: The real communist movement, as a conscious being, as party, has
been distinguished in its long historical struggle from all the forces
and ideologies of counter-revolution by affirming, each time more
clearly, the indissociable unity between **the dictatorship of the
proletariat and the abolition of wage labour**. The destruction of the
relations of capitalist production is necessarily a despotic activity
(the despotism of human needs against the law of value) by the organised
and centralised force of the proletariat imposing its class domination:
the worldwide proletarian state. This state is neither free nor popular,
because it does not unite different classes or strata of people. It is
exclusively the proletariat organised as party and is not constructed in
the interests of freedom, but on the basis of the need to repress all
the forces of reaction by revolutionary terror. The various currents
who, in the name of anti-authoritarianism, deny the need for any state
or claim to make the state of transition "free", "popular",
"democratic", or in which non-proletarian forces would participate, are
not only contributing to sowing confusion amongst proletarians but are
objectively serving the counter-revolution.

45: The **proletarian state** has nothing to do with the existing
bourgeois state or with a "workers'" government. The objective of the
proletariat's struggle is not to "take the political power of the state
and put it to its service", as the bourgeois state (whoever may be
leading it) will continue unstoppably to reproduce Capital. Any attempt
to use the bourgeois state in the service of the proletariat is a
reactionary utopia and is one of the best methods of the
counter-revolution for diverting the devastating effects of a workers'
insurrection against the bourgeois state and against the tyranny of
value valorising itself. The struggle of the proletariat has, on the
contrary, the objective of **the destruction, the demolition from top to
bottom of the bourgeois state and of its socio-economic power**. The
bourgeois state will never whither away. It is necessary to suppress and
demolish it by means of violence, at the same time as suppressing the
mercantile and democratic dictatorship from which it emerged and which
it reproduces. On the contrary, the only state which will whither away
is that of the proletariat (the "semi-state") which, in the course of
its development, consolidation and extension, abolishes itself in the
very process of liquidating Capital.

46: The **proletarian revolution** has therefore nothing to do with
taking over the leadership of the state with the aim of bringing about
"social reforms". By contrast, from its starting point to its final
objective, it is a social revolution, coming from the social need to
completely destroy the total power of bourgeois society (military,
economic, ideological, political...) and has communist society as its
objective. The revolution emerges from the separation of real human
beings from their collective being (Gemeinwesen) and its objective is
the constitution of **Man's true Gemeinwesen: the human being**. It is
obvious that this social revolution, in the sense that it requires the
overthrow of the existing power and contains the need for destruction
and dissolution, includes political struggle. However, when its
organised social activity begins and its own objective and content
arise, communism rejects its political envelope.

For this reason, proletarian revolution cannot be reduced to an economic
question of management of production, of workers' control, etc. In order
to realise the organised activity of society up to the achievement of
communism, proletarian revolution needs to violently destroy all the
institutions and apparatuses of the counter-revolution which assure and
maintain the dictatorship of value against human needs.

47: The politicist deviation according to which the proletariat is
supposed to take over capitalist society's state in order to reform
society and the economist deviation according to which the problem is
reduced to taking over, controlling and running production and
distribution are almost always combined into one and the same "theory".
They constitute fundamentally counter-revolutionary ideologies which
have, in crucial moments, served as ultimate barriers for the
maintenance of capitalist society. This is why the proletariat must
confront them, suppress them and bury them.

48: Obviously, before and during the whole phase of insurrection, the
proletariat will take over the means of production (factories,
communication centres, mines, fields...). All this activity will have to
have the internationally generalised triumph of the insurrection as its
central objective, firmly rejecting any illusions of managing society
without the destruction of the organised counter-revolution. To this
end, it is indispensable to achieve centralisation as well as the most
developed organisation of the proletariat into party as possible. Only
the **Communist Party**, solidly welded to its **historic programme**,
can develop a centralised and centralising action which can prevent
localist dispersion, self-managementist illusions, democratic federalism
and exchange between independent units of production (a source of
private labour opposed to social labour and therefore of mercantile
reorganisation). Only the Communist Party and its centralising action
can give a single direction to all proletarians and guarantee a maximum
concentration of forces for the social, economic and political crushing
of the counter-revolution.

49: Armed insurrection constitutes a qualitative leap in the struggle
but this leap is not irreversible. Armed insurrection does not destroy
the bourgeois state. This will only really be destroyed by the
liquidation of all the bases which underpin it and this is not possible
in one country or even a group of countries. This is why, in the
proletarian bastions where the insurrection has triumphed, the
proletariat will have to use the power it possesses over that part of
world capitalist society to expropriate and attack Capital on every
terrain (politico-military, propagandist, economic, etc.), directly
taking every possible means in hand to orientate production and
distribution in accordance with its needs and interests (that is the
needs and interests of humanity). This implies the destruction of
commodity society and wage labour. However, all these measures must be
strictly subordinated to a central objective: **extending the revolution
on a worldwide level**. Every illusion concerning the possibility of
constructing a "workers' state" (or several of them!) in the midst of
the worldwide commodity-producing economy must be rejected as must, even
more so, the illusion of constructing socialism in one country or group
of countries. This is why it is indispensable that the centralisation
and the effective leadership of the communist movement should be unique
and global and that every regionalist and nationalist interest (always
bourgeois) should be firmly combated, each part being subordinated to
the general interests of the movement. Only **the compact and organic
centralisation** of the world proletariat, constituted as party and
fortified programmatically, numerically, organisationally and militarily
in insurrectional battles, will be able to confront all attempts at
capitalist restoration.

50: The proletarian revolution has nothing in common with the political
"revolutions" of the bourgeoisie -- neither in its objectives nor in its
intermediate phases, except when it comes to the use of arms and to the
overthrow of the existing power.

Bourgeois "revolutions" try to change the personnel of the government or
one form of national state for another. Proletarian revolution, on the
other hand, has to destroy the national state and liquidate every nation
or country.

Bourgeois "revolutions" are made in the name of the well-being of the
people and reproduce wage slavery for most of society. They use social
terminology to better pursue their limited political ends, using
universal discourse to assert the particular interests of specific
minorities. Proletarian revolution, by contrast, however regional its
starting point may be, however minoritarian the faction which first
throws itself into struggle, however poor and politically limited its
phrases may be... possesses in itself a universal social content.

Bourgeois "revolutions" are based on democracy and citizens' rights:
they start out from the necessity for one bourgeois fraction to no
longer be separated from the collective being of Capital, the state and
they aspire either to control or to divide up political power in the
very bosom of democracy. Proletarian revolution starts out from an
entirely different reality, because the collective being from which the
worker is separated is a collective being with a reality and content
quite distinct from the political community. This collective being, this
community from which they are separated by their own work, is life
itself -- physical and intellectual life, human activity, human
pleasure, being human. The proletarian revolution does not therefore
aspire to democratically divide up power but, on the contrary, arises
from the imperious necessity to **liquidate this power, this democracy
and everything which separates the proletariat from its humanity, from
its Gemeinwesen**. "The human being is the veritable Gemeinwesen of
Man".

51: To finish off, it seems indispensable to us to underline the
decisive importance of the **Communist Party**. The proletariat cannot
exist as a class or as a historical force without its constitution as
party.

Calling for the party today signifies a reclaiming and reappropriation
of its invariant conception at the same time as separating ourselves
from all the democrats, by insisting that this central issue of the
Programme is not "a problem apart". Class and party are not two
different historic entities which should be separately defined only to
form a relationship later. On the contrary, they are the distinct
expressions of one and the same historic being: **Communism**.

The essential determinations of the party cannot therefore be understood
from contingent realities or one-off necessities without falling
inevitably into immediatist conceptions (Leninist or anti-Leninist).
These invariably define "Class" on one side (as if it were possible for
this to be defined without its constitution into party) and on the other
side "party" (in general defined in terms of an historic ideal) so as to
later try to reconcile the two concepts, that is to "link" what they
have separated ideologically. The polarisations within this immediatist
democratic conception take place subsequently in the search for
definitions of the "relationship" between "Class" and "Party". In the
same way, the fundamental historical determinations of the party have
nothing in common either with the existence of some or other
self-proclaimed "parties", little groups which pretend to possess
"consciousness", nor with the socio-economic adding up of proletarians.

On the contrary, for us the **party** is **communism constituted as a
centralised international force.** It is the indispensable condition for
establishing communist society and its living prefiguration.

52: The Communist Party is therefore the organisation of the
revolutionary class which will bring about communism. Its essential
determinations are those which make the proletariat into a class:
**organicity, centralisation and a single historic leadership**. Without
affirming the party, even in any embryonic form, the proletariat does
not exist. ("The working class is revolutionary or it is nothing".)
However, the whole process of organising into party is impossible
without the long and indispensable militant work of programmatical
affirmation, of consequent practice and of revolutionary preparation
undertaken by **communists**. It is clear that the party (just like
revolutions) is not invented nor created by revolutionaries. It is the
necessary and spontaneous product of capitalist society itself.
However, this historical necessity does not concretise itself from one
day to the next into the full and complete existence of the worldwide
party. The party arises spontaneously, in that it develops inevitably on
the basis of a community of interests and perspectives, a real
**community of proletarian struggle**. This inevitable fact can only
concretise itself when, at the heart of this community, communism is
simultaneously affirmed as its programme and leadership, prefiguring
**the international organ of revolutionary leadership**. That is, when
this historical determination specifically concretises itself in a
conscious, wilful and organised action, when a compact minority of
solidly organised revolutionary cadres ("the Communists", as they are
referred to in the Communist Manifesto) affirms the historical programme
of the proletariat and assumes the indispensable task of leadership, not
only concerning the objectives of the movement (as the "life plan" for
the human species) but also concerning the strategic and tactical means
for its triumph.

Revolutions and the party cannot be created. The function of
revolutionaries is to lead revolutions and the party. This minority of
communists is a necessary and spontaneous (in the historic and not
immediate sense of the word) product of the organisation of the
proletariat as a single and centralised force and is also the axis
around which it realises the inversion of praxis, permitting its passage
from a simple object of this spontaneity to a conscious subject of the
revolution to come.

53: Communists do not, therefore, form a party separate from and opposed
to other proletarian associations or, even less, to the organisation of
the proletariat. They do not have specific interests which separate them
from the whole of the proletariat. They do not proclaim particular
principles to which they must submit the proletarian movement.
Communists only distinguish themselves from other proletarians in the
community of struggle of which they are a part. In the various struggles
they highlight and assert interests common to the whole proletariat,
independent of nationality ("the history of the International has been a
continuous struggle of the General Council against... the national
sections"). They always represent the interests of the communist
movement as a whole during the different phases through which the
struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie passes. **Practically**,
the communists are the most resolute faction within the proletarian
struggle in all countries. They are the organ which always pushes and
carries the other sectors forward. **Theoretically**, they have the
advantage over the rest of the proletariat of having a clear
understanding of the conditions, the course and the general results of
the proletarian movement.

The specific organisation of communists has nothing to do with the
constitution of a separate party but, on the contrary, it practically
affirms the general tendency for the proletariat to constitute itself
into party, to equip itself with a **central organ**.

It is evident that this conception of the party and of the activity of
communists opposes itself radically and totally to all the democratic
ideologies, some of which are worth summarising here:

* The theory of communists as repositories and bearers of consciousness.

* The "anti-substitutionist" theory according to which communists must
not assume practical tasks within the movement (organisation and
direction of action).

* Finally, all the theories which advocate, in one way or another, the
dissolution of the specific organisation of communists into workers'
assemblies or councils.

54: The present epoch (as well as future epochs) is one of growing
socio-economic and political crisis of Capital on the international
level and of irregular and difficult reemergences of the proletariat on
the worldwide level. The present epoch affirms the tendency to the
_worldwide organisation of the proletariat_, albeit with enormous
difficulties given the decades of uninterrupted counter-revolution, the
cracks only appearing with the great social explosions which are
becoming more and more frequent. It is also an epoch in which groups
organised consciously and determinedly on the basis of the affirmation
of the communist programme are a tiny minority. It is a period in which
the fundamental characteristics of the sectarian phases which precede
all phases of real proletarian affirmation are being repeated, an epoch
in which the _developing community of struggle_ of the proletariat on a
world level against Capital is only conscious of its objectives in the
activity developed by a few nuclei of communist militants scattered
across the globe. The activity of organising and centralising this
community is and will be decisive. On the international level, the
activity of the class's real vanguard to enable this community of
struggle to become conscious of its own strength, objectives and
perspectives is and will be central.

This tendency towards the worldwide organisation of the proletariat,
towards its programmatical affirmation and its organic centralisation
confronts, and will do so each time more violently, all the forces and
ideologies of the counter-revolution as described in these Theses on a
partial level (although care has always been taken to expose their
common essence). This tendency particularly confronts all the "bearers
of consciousness for the class", all the builders of parties and
internationals who consider that the "objective conditions" are ripe and
that having "consciousness and will" is enough to create the party", the
"International" and who, in practice, are acting in flagrant opposition
to the _community of action of the revolutionary proletariat_.

55: In spite of the fact that we are living through an embryonic phase
of reconstitution of the proletariat (a sectarian phase par excellence),
in spite of the deficiencies, weaknesses, partial experiences and
general ignorance of the activity undertaken by communist factions, the
need for international centralisation, the need to build a single
internationalist and communist leadership is making itself felt all over
the world today, albeit in an embryonic form.

Ranged against this development are a collection of ideologies which,
once again constitute the main obstacle to this tendency. In the first
place, it is important to point out all the ideologies which suppose
that the future "International" will arise by a simple addition of
already constituted national parties. Along the same lines, there is a
whole series of "creators of internationals" who, in general, have
almost nothing to do with the international proletariat's real community
of life and struggle and who, through interminable theoreticist debates
come up with a collection of formal principles to which they intend to
make the movement adhere. They even manage to dream up a collection of
ideological norms (declaration of principles) which, according to them,
will guarantee against deviations.

No organisation, no product of the working class serving the social
revolution, has ever been organised on such a basis. This is the classic
schema for Capital's ideological organisations, from churches to the
bourgeois political parties.

In particular, all these builders of internationals are following the
historical line of the Second International and its formal centre.

**The international organisation of the proletariat** will be the
historic (and not immediate) product of the organisation and
centralisation of the **community of struggle** against Capital, which
develops practically and as such will be, once again, **outside and
against** all those who claim to mould the movement by proclaiming a
collection of ideological principles from the heights of their
pedestals.

The effective prefiguration of tomorrow's international party already
exists today in the real action of a whole of not yet centralised
proletarian minorities who, in the real struggle and through their
successive ruptures, join the historical line of the invariant programme
and the party.

56: Our little group is an expression of this community of struggle of
the proletariat and emanates from its tendency towards programmatical
reappropriation of all of the age-old experience accumulated by the
world proletariat, a manifestation of its international reconstruction
and its global centralisation.

In concrete terms, our group is the product of the centralisation of a
whole of negations, ruptures, experiences of struggle and balance-sheets
of defeats. This centralisation is undertaken by various comrades at
various latitudes and is transformed on the basis of communist theory,
the accumulated experience of generations of revolutionaries throughout
the world, as well as of organized and conscious collective efforts,
into a living and active force for the international centralisation of
the proletariat. Thus the **Internationalist Communist Group** acts in a
conscious and determined way on the basis of the invariant communist
programme (of which these Theses are one expression) to **lead** the
process of the constitution of the World Communist Party and the
Communist Revolution.

This gigantic, age-old and invariant task of consciously and
determinedly assuming the material determinations which push forward the
development of the community of struggle of the proletariat will be
achieved through the collective work of thousands of revolutionary
cadres. It constitutes the indispensable premise for the party and the
Revolution of tomorrow and is already assumed today by revolutionary
groups and militants in different parts of the world.

Given the conditions from which this community of revolutionary action
emerges, following decades of counter-revolution, it is now more evident
than ever that this community is a _practical_ community of proletarian
needs and interests, asserted and produced in the confrontation against
Capital and crystallised in the action of vanguard minorities well
before it becomes a community of consciousness (even as far as the
minorities are concerned). Thus, the organisation and centralisation of
this community will assert itself on the basis of coordinated action
against Capital (action that is already developing today in
non-organised forms), necessarily opposing all kinds of criteria of
ideological demarcation. Its organisation and centralisation will have
an eminently practical demarcation, through struggle. Theoretical
differences and discrepancies, even major ones, are (and will continue
to be) inevitable at the heart of this developing community, within
every group of militants who are acting to lead this process (including
our own Group). The only way to resolve them will be within this
community, the unique political space where discussion takes place
_amongst comrades_.

57: To be situated today **in the historic line** of the party (as far
as our feeble forces permit) signifies acting as the most resolute
elements, those who push forward the rest of the proletariat.

To be situated today in the historic line of the party signifies acting,
in the most consistent way possible, within the real community of
struggle against Capital, to try to make it conscious of its own
existence, of its strength, of its perspectives, to organise it and to
direct it.

To be situated today in the historic line of the party signifies, with
the same emphatic firmness with which we confront the enemy in all its
variants (including opportunism and centrism), being comrades in
solidarity with all proletarians in struggle against Capital throughout
the world.

To be situated today in the historic line of the party means
passionately continuing the historic work begun by **communist
factions** to draw up balance sheets of past experiences and defeats.
It means working tirelessly towards the formation of revolutionary
cadres.

To be situated today in the historic line of the party is to take on
board the fact that our group, like any other group of revolutionaries
in the world, is a necessary and indispensable expression and structure
for the constitution of the party. But this expression _is not the party
itself_. In the development of the party, in terms of the historical
arc, our group, like the others, is no more than an ephemeral episode in
the life of the party and its attempts to constitute an _organ of
international leadership_.

In the same way that the League of Communists and the International were
only an episode (albeit indispensable) in the life of the party, our
action and our will are explicitly and consciously led in the direction
of _superseding the present "small-group form"_, even if it is, without
doubt, an indispensable mediation for bringing about this supersession.
It is idealist and reactionary to speak of the historical party without
being consistent and taking on practical activity that is necessarily in
the small-group form. However, it is fundamental and demarcatory to be
clear that such a group is not an end in itself but rather a mediation
to supersede itself.

58: On the basis of these Theses we call on all militants and
revolutionary groups to centralise their efforts with our own in the
struggle for **the dictatorship of the proletariat for the abolition of
wage labour**. Within the community of struggle of which we are a part,
it is not a question of totting up ideological points of divergence and
convergence, but rather of effectively coordinating the common practice
that we are already undertaking and which will be reinforced by this
coordination. Nor is it a question of resolving the insufficiencies and
weaknesses which we all carry, each for his own and on his own patch --
this is impossible. On the contrary, the issue is to structure and
centralise the common practice which unites us and which constitutes the
adequate framework for militant discussion, to resolve the enormous
problems that face us. Comrades, the necessary revolutionary leadership
will clarify itself by consistent revolutionary practice in response to
all levels and all plans of attack by Capital. Up until now, all
so-called "revolutions" have been made in the name of science and reason
and, correspondingly, their ideologists have always elaborated a list of
principles with which they tried to mould the movement. This has nothing
in common with the revolution that we have before us. The Communist
revolution will surge from the more real and deeper necessity of real
concrete human beings, the proletariat asserting its interests for a
truly human life. As such, the revolution for which we struggle is and
will be in complete rupture with all ideology, all science, all reason
and the very idea of progress.

**Comrades**, let's realise what we really are and that for which we
have risen up. Let's realise the consistent and revolutionary practice
of **Communism, the Communist Party**.

[^01]: We have to mention here that we are applying this general
  statement, above all, to ourselves and to the task of writing these
  theses. Thus, this difficult international collective work that we
  continue and will continue to assume has permitted, within our small
  group, the international centralisation of polemics and the
  crystallization of a whole of decisive divergences which, on several
  occasions, ended in resignations, exclusions, etc. Despite the
  sometimes virulent polemics and internal/public confrontations between
  various positions, the centralisation of these polemics by way of a
  whole of internal international structures, has permitted not only a
  programmatical advance for our group, but also a much sharper
  demarcation from the heirs of the left of social democracy. In this
  sense and despite the exhaustion of militant energy these polemics
  entailed, we consider it to be indispensable and fruitful not only for
  our formation as militants but also for an increasingly precise
  delimitation of our movement in the face of all the bourgeois parties
  and ideologies created against the proletariat.

[^02]: Despite all the difficulties presented by formal-logical and
  bourgeois language, we are trying to express, in the most precise
  possible way, the subject of revolution at the same time as our
  concept of communism. For us the concept of communism is not an ideal
  to be applied, but the movement of destruction of the society of
  capital and the society resulting from this practical negation.

	Contrary to what idealists believe, the true subject of the revolution
	is not an inspired individual wearing his conscience and his will on
	his sleeve. Nor is it a group of militants, even if its action in
	terms of historical leadership is decisive. Nor is it the whole of the
	proletariat seen as a group of workers. The real subject of the
	revolution is only the proletariat as a force constituted as a party,
	as a communist organic centrality that abolishes established order.
	Despite what social democracy may think, it is not the leadership
	which transforms the "trade unionist" proletariat into a revolutionary
	force. On the contrary, it is the proletariat as a revolutionary force
	which determines the creation of a revolutionary direction (not from
	an immediatist, contingent and localist point of view, but from a
	historical, general and international one).

	Against the current of dominant ideology and at the risk of shocking,
	we can state, if we put ourselves at a higher level of abstraction,
	that it is not communists or the proletariat which turn social
	movement into communist movement but, on the contrary, it is
	_communism_ as a historical movement which, for the first time in
	history, finds in the proletariat a truly revolutionary class capable
	of imposing communism as an effective negation. It is _communism_
	which co-opts the most historically decisive elements of the class,
	those which always put forward the interests of the _whole of the
	proletariat_ as the leadership of the party and the Revolution to
	come.
