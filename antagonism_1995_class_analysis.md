This article is an attempt at communication with individuals and groups
involved in subversive activity. The background of all present radical
struggles is an attack on the social relation of capital, whether or not
this is realised by the participants. The destruction of modern global
conditions implies a global struggle; the only terrain on which a
world-wide struggle can be fought is one which centres on a global
class. The success of all or any of the partial struggles now being
fought (over wages, squatting, environmental defence, work refusal etc.)
means an extension and integration of proletarian struggle. An
understanding of class relationships, although useless on its own, can
lead to a greater effectiveness of our own struggles. This analysis has
been developed out of practical experience. It is hoped that it may have
practical results, that it is not theory separate from practise.

I have found that apparently minor disagreements on class analysis (such
as whether teachers are middle class or working class) can turn out
after much discussion to rely on very basic disagreements as to how the
world is. In particular, disagreements on the nature of truth. Therefore
it is necessary to start at a very basic level. My own understanding of
the world is materialist. But I don't plan to waste much time arguing
materialism versus idealism. The opposing world views are so far apart
that there is no common ground to argue from. I will state though that
the world is made and remade by material forces not by ideas. For
instance, it may be or may not be the case that your ideas change after
reading this. But any such change would be totally irrelevant if your
actions, your behaviour do not change as well. In any case, ideas are
not changed merely by the reading of some article, but in the context of
some wider experience. If that were not the case then everyone reading
the same stuff would end up thinking the same thing, which certainly
isn't what happens.

## Where is your truth, when god is dead?

In some societies such as Europe in Medieval Times, and perhaps in some
modern theocracies, it was the case that truth was something that
appeared to come from outside of society. Certain important disputes
were argued out and decided upon according to a fixed official truth. In
Medieval Europe the fixed truth was the scriptures. The particular
interpretation of the "fixed truth" might in fact be determined
according to interests of the most powerful groups in society, but it
was nevertheless the case that there existed some reference point around
which important disputes would turn. In particular, revolutionary class
struggles in the Middle Ages seemed always to have religious
disagreements that corresponded to the opposing class forces. (For
instance, the Münster commune was created by Anabaptists, the Taborites
were also protestants who fought against the established church, and the
various class forces in the English civil war also had their own
religious sects.)

This state of affairs was smashed by the bourgeois revolution. God was
ripped from the centre of society leaving a vacuum that cannot be filled
by a constantly developing science. With no generally accepted truth,
new opposing truths are developed by contradictory sections of society.
Nowhere is this more obviously so than in the area of class theory.

One current capitalist version of class theory is based on sociology.
With this method, society is categorised according to type of
occupation, education, and salary. In one variant, skilled workers are
categorised as C2's, for example. This class analysis is used most
especially by the advertising industry. In order to maximise sales,
advertising is aimed at particular groups. More interestingly, this type
of analysis is also used by political parties in order to maximise the
efficiency of their campaigning. In Britain, the C2's are seen by most
political pundits as a crucial territory on which to fight. People lower
down the scale might have a tendency to vote Labour, those higher up
Conservative. Skilled workers are a significant group where careful
campaigning and policy making can tip the scales one way or the other.
The Conservative policies of selling off council houses, mortgage relief
and of widespread share issues, were deliberately aimed at this group.
Their use of the sociological class analysis has been crucial to their
continued grip on power. This theory is therefore certainly true; it
corresponds in an exact way with the real world. But it is only true for
capitalist forces. It corresponds to their worldview, it is useful for
them to plan their strategies against us. It is true, but true only for
the capitalist class in the maintenance of its power. We need class
theory for an entirely different reason. We wish to understand this
society in order to destroy it. Therefore our theory must be based not
on the scientific notion of categorising differentiable strata, but
instead on the active relationship of different groups, with each other,
and with capitalism and the struggle against it.

## Class in History

Every civilised society has been a class society. Each of these
societies has based its civilisation, its culture, its technology, on
the oppression of the majority by a minority. The earliest civilisations
were based on open class power. The main productive class were the
slaves, who originally were kidnapped from free communities or rival
civilised societies. Over time, the master/slave relationship became
accepted by both parties as normal, and the slaves participated in the
reproduction of their slavery. In more recent times, the place of the
slave class was taken by that of the peasant. The peasants lived in
their own village communities. But these communities were not the free
communities that existed before (or outside of) civilisation. The
communities were dominated by the power of the lord, the church, and
eventually the state. These forces were external to the agrarian
community but none the less played an important role within it. The lord
was the protector of the community (providing a form of protection that
is usually associated with organised crime), the peasants worked perhaps
one day a week on his lands in return for his care. This relationship
also tended to become accepted, and both lord and peasant recognised a
system of complementary rights and duties.

Previous historical societies had class relationships that were very
different from today's. But these relationships are also recognisable.
Workers are often referred to as wage-slaves, and although workers are
not bought and sold, but are legally free, this phrase has some obvious
reality to it. How do we relate our own class oppression to the class
oppression of our ancestors? What is the common factor in all systems of
class domination? The answer, which is both obvious and commonly denied,
is the existence of social power. In all class societies, the members of
the lowest class have their power alienated from them in one way or
another. This alienated power is wielded by the ruling class and their
functionaries. In ancient societies, the power of the slave was
alienated absolutely, so that the slave was an object, a simple
commodity to be bought and sold, a dog to be kicked. The peasant on the
other hand, was allowed a measure of social autonomy, within strict
limits. Today the alienated power of the majority is wielded especially
by the functionaries of capital and by the agents of state and
spectacle. This use of alienated social power is an active relationship
with those it is used against.

## "Marxism"

The society we live in is capitalist, characterised by wage labour, a
centralised state, commodity production, the accumulation of capital.
Can we still talk of class being determined by power in this society?
The first "coherent" class analysis I came across was a Trotskyist
version, touted by the Workers Revolutionary Party, the then official
British section of the 4th International. The class theory they put
across was that class position is determined by whether or not a person
owned capital. Those that owned a large amount are the bourgeoisie,
those who own a small amount, petty bourgeois, the rest of us working
class. This theory (which is held by many more or less marxist groups)
obviously has a lot going for it. Ownership of capital definitely is
important in capitalist society! But the theory also has serious flaws
in it. The biggest problem was revealed by the WRP's analysis of the
Soviet Union. The USSR had all the typical social relations of
capitalism; wage-labour, commodity production, etc. However it did not
have a class of people who owned capital. The position of the WRP was
therefore that the USSR did not have a capitalist class and was a form
of worker's state. The idiocy of this position does not come from the
WRP misusing the theory, but from the theory itself. A class analysis
that looks only at whether individuals own capital or not to determine
their class position, is worse than useless. It provides a theoretical
justification for supporting particular states which are in every way
capitalist. It fails to locate the real fault lines in all modern
societies.

Ownership of capital is a crucial determinant of class; if you own a
large amount of capital you are a capitalist. But it is incorrect to
turn this statement round. It is not true that not owning capital makes
you proletarian. The Soviet Union was a capitalist state with a class
society. The class contradiction was not one of ownership against
non-ownership, it was one of possession of social power against
powerlessness. The ruling class, the capitalist class of the USSR were
the top managers who commanded its economy, its state and its
ideological apparatus. The intermediate class between capital and labour
was primarily that of the lower managers, whose job it was to rule the
enterprises on a day to day basis.[^01] This recognition of the forms
of class power in the USSR leads us directly to an examination of
so-called mixed economies such as Britain. In Britain too there is state
ownership of certain industries. Certainly traditional bourgeois benefit
from these industries (through the advantages of planning, or subsidies,
etc.) but these industries are not capitalist by proxy. State industries
are in no way "socialist" (in the non-capitalist sense). The
nationalised industries use wage-labour in order to produce and
accumulate surplus value; this is the very essence of capitalist
production relations. The individuals who run these industries are
themselves a part of the capitalist class in their own right. Finally we
look at private enterprises. The stereotypical description of a
capitalist enterprise is of a factory owned by a capitalist who controls
it directly. This quaint vision must be well over a century out of date
(in as much as it was ever really accurate). Typical private enterprises
today are owned collectively by capital, through multiple share
ownership by both individuals and institutions. They are not operated
primarily by individual bourgeois but by top managers. In free market
societies, as in state controlled societies, the capitalist class
includes top managers, the middle class includes lower managers. In the
free market these strata exist alongside private capitalists and petty
bourgeois. The bourgeoisie, the owners of capital, are ruling class not
because they are rich and we aren't. The bourgeoisie are ruling class
because their ownership of capital gives them certain rights, abilities,
power over productive forces (including variable capital, i.e. their
employees). Ownership of capital is only a form of class power that
appears in particular variants of capitalism. It has its own
characteristics but also has some continuity with other forms of
domination, just as the proletarian condition has similarities (as well
as differences) to historical forms of subjugation.

## Wages

I will mention another variety of false class theory. Sometimes, it is
claimed that class is determined by the amount of wages that a person
receives. Now, there is a class difference between the rich and the
poor, but this is not due to wage differentials. A class analysis based
on wage differences would result in "an infinity of classes". There
would also be the problem with differences in wages paid in different
regions; either we have regional class differences or regional
variations in class analyses. Silly. More to the point such a theory
fails to understand what wage differences are about. At one level, wages
are determined by the class war, with higher wages reflecting successful
struggle by workers. But this is only one side of the story as wages are
determined within the context of the capitalist system. In part they
reflect the different exchange value of different forms of labour power;
some people are paid more because their labour power is more expensive
to reproduce. More commonly, wages vary due to fluctuations in the
labour market, reflecting supply and demand for different types of
labour. Most importantly, wage differentials are deliberately created by
capital in order to divide the proletariat. The class is divided by
jealousy or elitism, against itself. Basing a class analysis on wage
differentials means taking artificial divisions created by capitalism to
ensure its own survival, and then deliberately accentuating them. Such
theory does capitalism's work for it, and against us.

## Communist Analyses

The class analyses I have criticised so far have been essentially, or
absolutely, counterrevolutionary. They are used more or less consciously
to defend capitalism (though not in each individual instance of their
use). There are also class analyses produced by revolutionary currents
which I believe are incorrect. Jean Barrot's "Capitalism and Communism",
which appeared in "Eclipse and Re-emergence of the Communist Movement",
is perhaps the best introduction to communist theory. Especially because
it recognises the limitations of theory, and the poverty of what
normally passes as theoretical activity. His description of what the
proletariat is, for the most part, is an excellent
modernisation/generalisation of Marx's theory. One position I disagree
with though, is his characterisation of the proletariat as "those who
have no reserves". Barrot attributes this phrase to the Left Communist
Bordiga but says his purpose was to go back to "the general definition".
The function of this definition in Barrot's theory, is to make the
struggle of the proletariat primarily a struggle against economic
oppression. The class struggle then becomes a function of the ill health
of capital. This process is obviously a major source of class
composition and class struggle, but is far from adequate to describe the
proletariat. If we accept this definition, then we should also accept
the arguments of those sociologists, who (especially in the 60's and
70's) declared that the proletariat no longer existed in the developed
countries. We should also accept the arguments of liberals and
Trotskyists, that revolution is now located in the third world. The
Trotskyists say this because western workers are a labour aristocracy
and the real proletariat are the impoverished workers overseas. The
liberals say it because the west is their (imperfect) paradise, and the
third world countries need a democratic revolution to achieve our own
general conditions of existence. Barrot recognises alienation as a
producer of the proletariat but makes too much of the economic
imperatives. Barrot is being too economistic in fact. If we go back to
"Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Introduction" as Barrot
recommends, we see that "the proletariat .. is ... formed ...from the
mass of people issuing from society's acute disintegration and in
particular from the ranks of the middle class". This identification of
the middle class origin of the proletariat ties in with comments in the
"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts" on the workers alienation from
the product of their labour.

>"...man reproduces himself not only intellectually, in his
consciousness, but actively and actually, and he can therefore
contemplate himself in a world he himself created. In tearing away the
object of his production from man, estranged labour therefore tears away
from him his species-life..."

This idea that workers (who might be women or men) create themselves in
the creation of their product, is almost incomprehensible in really
modern industry. Most workers hardly see the product they collectively
produce. Where they are really directly involved in its production, then
the division of labour is so acute, that they have no room to assert
their individuality in the productive process. This was not true in
Marx's day. At this time, petty-bourgeois producers were being collected
together to produce as proletarians for a single capitalist in
manufacturing. Or else petty-bourgeois or manufacturing workers were
being collected together in the new social institution of the factory.
These new proletarians, issuing from the disintegration of middle-class
society, would really have directly felt the alienation of the product
of their labour, which previously they themselves would have owned, but
which now was possessed by the capitalist. From this we can see the
importance of alienation, ahead of impoverishment in Marx's theory, as
well as the archaic form of alienation which he talked of in the above
passage. Alienation is still the crucial pre-condition for the
proletariat, but today takes on yet more acute forms. Nowadays, the
worker is alienated from their product to the degree that they hardly
recognise it as their own product. The process of producing yourself
through your product is itself an almost alien concept. It belongs to
another world.

If in general, we can say that Marx's class theory was correct for its
time, we should also point out his most spectacular failure in class
analysis. In _Statism and Anarchy_, Bakunin had written that

>"former workers .. as soon as they have become rulers and
representatives, cease to be workers .. and look down on the whole
common workers' world from the height of the state. They will no longer
represent the common people but only their own claims to rule them."

Marx responded that workers, as representatives or governors, cease to
be workers "as little as a factory owner today ceases to be a capitalist
if he becomes a municipal councillor." Here Marx misses the point
disastrously. Proletarians are defined by their alienation, just as
bourgeois are defined by their possession of capital. Factory owners are
not proletarianised by the assumption of even greater alienated social
power. But proletarians cease to be such when they become
representatives, because they take on the power that a ruler or
representative possess by definition. Marx is useful where he talks
about alienation or political economy, but his politics (and activity)
were mostly bourgeois.

## Class theory and its use

So far a way of determining the class position of different groups in
society has been identified, by analysing the amount of social power
that they wield. But it has not yet been said what this characterisation
means, how it helps us. The utility of class analysis is in identifying
the material interests of different social groups, both in the day to
day running of capital, and in the on going struggle against it. The
main reason why the proletariat is so often identified as the
revolutionary class, is precisely because it has no material interest in
the maintenance of capitalism, either immediately or in the long term.
The capitalist class, both owners and top managers, are the class that
directly benefits from the present society, and will organise whatever
measures are necessary to ensure its continued existence. The middle
class, be they petty bourgeois, peasants or the new middle class, are
society's leftovers.

The middle class are both exploiter and exploited, or they are neither;
they have some small privilege but no real security. Proletarianisation
is a constant imminent danger for the middle class, and something they
always fight to prevent. This struggle can be reactionary where it means
a struggle against the proletariat to defend middle class position. But
it can potentially be revolutionary when it is a struggle against
capital's encroachment, and can lead to united action with the
proletariat. In general, the middle class are only defined by their
position in this society, and not by their struggles. This is because
this class has no clear class interest in or against capital, and so
never struggles as a class.

The proletariat is defined first of all by its dispossession. It exists
as a negativity, as something alienated from this society, and which can
never be wholly integrated. These radical chains lead to radical
struggle. Proletarian struggles are always anti-capitalist (in
potential) because the proletariat can find no liberation within
capitalism. Its struggle therefore tends towards an all out struggle
against capital. This tendency comes to the fore only too rarely. Most
of the time the proletariat exists primarily as a class defined by
capitalism. Only through struggle can it form itself into a community
consciously opposed to capitalism. The material conditions of existence
of the class precede radical class consciousness.

The capitalist class is a small minority of the world population.
Capitalism requires competition and therefore struggles between rival
capitals. The capitalist class can therefore never be fully unified.
However, capitalists must struggle not only against themselves, but also
against all the other classes. The ruling class is under permanent
assault from many directions. This results in a high degree of class
consciousness possessed by the capitalist class. When a powerful
anti-capitalist struggle breaks out, rival capitals can temporarily bury
the hatchet and act in concert against the proletariat. The usual
stereotype of the bourgeois is of a fat, top-hatted oaf, smoking a large
cigar. It should be realised that the ruling class is small, fast and
ruthless.

So who are our enemies; just the capitalist class or both they and the
middle class? When it comes down to it the answer is: neither. What
really destroys us is not the rich or their functionaries, it is the
social relations of capitalism. It is the accumulation of capital, wage
labour, social isolation, the state, borders, and more besides, that we
are really need to do away with. In as much as the capitalist class, the
middle class, or even the working class defend these relationships they
act against our own liberation and the liberation of humanity as a
whole. The point about class analysis, is that we can see who is most
likely to defend these relations, and who is most likely to attack them.
I once had a talk with someone who said that we should reopen Auschwitz
and exterminate the richest 2% in this country. This kind of extremism
has a sort of gut appeal. But there were a couple of problems. One was
that this guy was a South African fascist who identified himself as an
Anglo-Saxon. He argued that apartheid was more strongly established in
the UK than it then was in South Africa, and that the ruling class was
entirely of Norman origins. His wish to wipe out the rich was akin to
the Nazi extermination of (Jewish) finance capitalists. The second
problem was the industrial, and therefore capitalist, nature of his
solution. The reason that we can't use prisons, concentration camps, or
even firing squads for our liberation is not that we are liberals who
respect an absolute right to life. It's because these are dehumanising
institutions for the jailers as well as the condemned. Rebel violence
can be liberating, but can never be institutional. We use enough
violence to achieve our aims; we need to create a new community out of
our struggle, hopefully as many people as possible can be integrated
into this human community as rapidly as possible. As the revolution
develops, more and more people will be attracted to it. We aim to unite
with whoever really shares our struggle no matter what role they play
under normal conditions. The situationist Ratgeb/Vaneigem expressed this
brilliantly: "Doesn't it give you a certain sense of pleasure to think
how, some day soon, you will be able to treat as human beings those cops
whom it will not have been necessary to kill on the spot?"

## Back to reality

This article has presented a theory, an analytical tool. But it has done
it in a too abstract way. Where did these thoughts come from, a book, a
discussion, a dream? These ideas did not appear fully formed but have
been put together by me from my own experiences in this society, and my
own experiences in my struggle against it, as well as from talking with
other radicals and reading different books. This is a process started
perhaps fifteen years ago and still continuing (though my ideas on class
have only changed in details in the last eight years, say). I will
retell some of my own experiences, so that you can understand more where
I am coming from, and to bring this down to earth a bit more.

## "But Teacher!"

My first involvement in any collective class struggle was at age eleven.
At that time I was going to the comprehensive school on the council
estate where I lived. Most of the kids there were working class, or else
they were lower middle class. (Of course they all had similar amounts of
social power, none, but where people are "temporarily" outside of the
cycle of accumulation, it is probably sensible to look at their class
background.) That year there were a number of teachers' strikes which
resulted in some disruption of classes. We even got sent home early a
couple of times, which was brilliant. Some kid, with a good sense of
humour, had the idea that we should all go on strike "in support" of the
teachers. Basically we just all met up at the tennis courts and didn't
return to lessons. What was the reaction of the teachers to this mass
"support" for their cause? They made no attempt at fraternisation with
us. Their only response was to try to get us to return to normal
passivity. One vision that stays with me is of one of the teachers, a
leftwinger, fighting with one of the fifth years to prevent him joining
our strike. All the teachers, and all the pupils recognised the true
situation, that there could be no unity between the students and staff,
only class conflict. Teachers, as part of their job, have a role in
supervising and disciplining pupils. They also disseminate capitalist
propaganda. Their role is one of socialising school kids into capitalist
normality, the five day week, obeying orders; even the more or less
useful stuff such as teaching kids to read is carried out because
capitalism needs an educated workforce. Teachers, at least those who
work in compulsory education, are part of the middle class, because of
the direct power they wield and because of their role in perpetuating
ruling class ideology (although they are not major players in this
field). Of course teachers do engage in collective class struggle. When
these struggles are not aimed at protecting their "status", but are for
a wage increase say, then we can even see some sort of "proletarian"
content. But struggles that go against this society, struggles which
hold the seeds of capitalism's destruction, are those that are
expansive, which tend to unite more and more people. Teachers are,
through their social position, divided against a large part of the
proletariat (schoolkids) and they will have to go that much further to
break from their social position. This doesn't mean that there can't be
some individuals who are more strongly against their official role, I
certainly have met a couple of teachers who have been involved in riots
for instance. But class analysis is not useful for predicting the
behaviour of each individual in a certain class position, only the
general characteristics of that group as a whole. I should add here that
there are certain categories of teachers, those who do not work in the
compulsory sector and who are not deeply involved in the reproduction of
ruling ideology, who are probably proletarian, or at least much closer
to that condition. I'm thinking in particular of those that work in
community education colleges, and some of those that do workplace
training. This is not because I want to make some exception, perhaps for
someone I know, but because they do not possess the criteria that make
them middle class; i.e. capital, power, a significant spectacular
function. This lack of homogeneity, sameness, is not just restricted to
teachers, but appears in almost any sociological grouping. I will say
again, sociology, the identification and classification of separate
groups in society, is of no use as a basis for radical class analysis.

## It's Official

I have worked only in the non-unionised private sector, or in temporary
or casual jobs. This, together with the fact that I had a basic
anarchist critique of unions before I left school, has meant that I have
never been a union member. To me they have always seemed organisations
of this society, not things outside or against it. This has meant that
much of my criticism of unions has been second hand, based on the
experiences of friends, family and comrades as well as stuff I have
read. I have only come into conflict with unions in certain large
workers' struggles, and first of all that against News International
1986-1987. This struggle started when the majority of the workforce was
sacked. The union tried to keep things legal and peaceful, supposedly
trying to win over public opinion. The struggle of the sacked printers,
local youths, and extremists was continuingly violent, aimed at the
cops, scabs and NI property. The police tactics were also very violent.
The top bureaucrats of course condemned any violent action by the
pickets (but not the cops) over their PA. This surprised no one of
course. What particularly struck me were the actions of the steward in
charge of the picket, Mike Hicks. He not only condemned the violence,
even that in self-defence, but called anyone attacking the police,
"agent provocateurs" (i.e. police agents). He also physically attacked
people who argued for this type of action. These counterrevolutionary
actions were carried out not by the top union bureaucrats, but by a low
level official. Hicks himself was a Stalinist, and so a more or less
conscious counterrevolutionary. But his actions are not so far removed
from that \[of\] other union officials. Unions are capitalist
institutions which have as their function the representation of variable
capital, i.e. workers. They negotiate the rate or form of exploitation,
according to their own interests (they need, from time to time to
demonstrate their usefulness to both boss and worker). They are entirely
part of the present system and can only attempt to repress any struggle
that goes against this system. Union officials, at all levels, are in
the belly of the beast, and are in fact separated from the proletariat.
This is due to the increased social power that they enjoy. Their middle
class nature can be seen by the fact that despite often being the most
militant of workers on day to day issues, in the more bitter struggles
they always play a conservative role, pulled three ways trying to
represent the workers, the union, and the manager or boss.

Growing up in a working class environment, I gained a hatred for the
police before gaining any formal radical politics. Friends and family
were arrested or imprisoned, the pigs came round our house to check up
on us, we were stopped and hassled in the street, they came to our
school to indoctrinate us. The "marxist" class theory, that just looks
at the relationship to capital, defines the police as proletarian,
because cops don't own any means of production. Some groups run with
this result, and call for the unionisation of the police (in Germany,
unionised cops have been on strike for more repressive powers). Other
groups find it embarrassing to define pigs as working class, and twist
their theory to correct this one error. In reality, police are middle
class, and not because they are the exception to the rule. They are the
purest example of holders of alienated social power. Those radicals who
call teachers or shop stewards "soft cops" hit the nail on the head;
these other middle class groups are only a diluted form of the
archetype.

## Contradictions

I have pointed out contradictions or capitalist interests in certain
class theories. I can't however claim that the one I have presented can
unerringly categorise every individual. One problem area is that of
"housewives" or other full-time unpaid carers. (The role of the
stereotypical housewife, who stays at home, looking after the house and
the kids, has gone into decline since the sixties. This is due both to
women's struggle, and to capitalist restructuring, away from the model
of factory and stable nuclear family. But this role is still something
of an archetype for women in this society.) "Housewives" and other
carers perform labour in the context of a capitalist society. They
produce and reproduce the commodity of labour power. The work they do is
productive labour appropriated by capital as surplus value. Having said
this, the category of "housewives", like the category of wage labourers,
is not homogeneous. Just as some wage labourers are middle class because
of the social power they wield, so it is with "housewives" as well.
These at first glance all appear to have the same social power and so
all appear to be of the same class. It would be wrong to argue this way.
As hinted at in the discussion above on school kids, in these areas,
where the means of subsistence aren't paid directly as a wage for work
done, it is often necessary to look at the "class background" of the
people involved. So that if a woman who doesn't go out to work is
married to a middle class man, it is probably reasonable to say that she
is middle class too. She would certainly share some of his material
interests, and therefore consciousness. It is still the case that
"housewives" don't have any direct usage of social power, and are
effectively unpaid workers, so this may mean a downward pressure on
class position, a partial proletarianisation. I am aware that this is a
weakness in the class analysis I have put forward. There are other
difficulties that now arise. What happens when a couple are from two
different classes, say one a manager, the other a non-supervisory
worker? From the example on housewives, we would have to say that the
non-supervisory worker is elevated into the middle-class. If this is
starting to get silly, it is not because the class analysis is totally
wrong, it is because this is the wrong way to use it. Classes are social
phenomenon, that are created in the mutual antagonism inherent in
exploitative society. Using class analysis to analyse individual people
in isolation is a moralistic endeavour, not a radical one. This is an
important fact that many leftists totally ignore. For them the ability
to individually "analyse" and condemn particular political enemies (or
justify themselves) is their only reason for using class theory.

## Class Community

Class is a social relation amongst large groups in society. It is not an
object open to scientific analysis but exists in the conflict between
classes. These class conflicts are power struggles primarily between a
minority of possessors of social power and a majority whose social power
is alienated from them. In capitalist society, alienation takes on
specific forms. These include direct authority relationships, capital,
and the spectacle. The function of, and need for a class theory is to
understand how to destroy capitalist society by and through the creation
of anti-capitalist modes of living. The revolutionary proletarian
struggle is not an attempt to raise the proletariat to the position of a
ruling class, but to abolish all classes through the destruction of
capitalist social relations. The real communist movement is our
struggle, the community we create through struggle against the social
relations that destroy us. Communist or anarchist society is the victory
of this real social movement, the generalisation of this human
community.

[^01]: Although Marx's _Capital_ was written half a century before
  state-capitalism started masquerading as socialism, some of Marx's
  comments still throw light on the social situation that existed in
  Russia. "An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a
  capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers), and
  sergeants (foremen, onlookers), who, while the work is being done,
  command in the name of the capitalist." and "It is not because he is
  a leader of industry that a man is a capitalist; on the contrary, he
  is a leader of industry because he is a capitalist. The leadership of
  industry is an attribute of capital..." volume 1, page 314, Lawrence
  and Wishart.
