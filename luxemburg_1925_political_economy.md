title: Introduction to Political Economy
author: Luxemburg, Rosa
date: 1925
description: This document has a complicated history. In Rosa Luxemburg Speaks, which collects sections 1.1, 1.5, and 1.6 as "What Is Economics?", editor Mary-Alice Waters writes that Rosa Luxemburg began lecturing on economics at the SPD party school in 1907. At this point she started on a manuscript for a comprehensive introduction to economics, but broke off work in 1912 (to work on the book The Accumulation of Capital, according to Hudis). While imprisoned during World War I she returned to this manuscript, but was not able to finish it before she was murdered by counter-revolutionaries in 1919. Parts of the manuscript may have been lost when her apartment was ransacked by these counter-revolutionaries. Paul Levi then worked to edit what was left of the manuscript and published it in 1925. This version of Introduction to Political Economy comes from the Complete Works of Rosa Luxemburg, Volume 1, edited by Peter Hudis, but omits the copious detailed notes and numbers chapters strictly sequentially (rather than using Luxemburg's original numbering, which, owing to the text's unfinished state, numbered the chapters chapters 1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 7).

## 1. What is political economy?

### 1.1

Political economy is a curious science. Difficulties and conflicting opinions arise at the very first step on its terrain, with the most basic question of all: What is the specific object of this science? The simple worker, who has only a rather vague idea of what political economy teaches, will ascribe his lack of understanding to his own inadequate general education. Yet, in some respects, he shares his misfortune here with many learned doctors and professors, who write thick volumes about political economy and deliver lectures to young people studying at the universities. Incredible as it sounds, the fact is that most specialists in political economy themselves have a very confused notion as to what the real object of their specialism is.

Since it is the custom for these learned gentlemen to work with definitions, that is, to reduce the nature of the most complex things to a few well-ordered sentences, we shall seek by way of example to find out from one official representative of political economy what this science is basically about. Let us listen first of all to what the doyen of the German professorial world, the author of countless frightfully thick textbooks on political economy, the founder of the so-called "historical school," Wilhelm Roscher, has to say on the subject. In his first major work, _Grundlagen der Nationalökonomie. Ein Hand- und Lesebuch für Geschäftsmänner und Studierende_ [Fundamentals of Political Economy. A Handbook and Textbook for Businessmen and Students], which appeared in 1854 and has since gone through twenty-three editions, we read in Chapter 2, paragraph 16:

>We understand by political economy the theory of national economic life, the theory of the laws of development of the national economy, of the economic life of the nation (philosophy of national economic history according to [Hans Karl Emil] von Mangoldt). This links up in one direction, like all sciences of national life, with consideration of the individual person; it expands in the other sense to the study of humanity as a whole.

Does this help "businessmen and students" understand what "national economic theory" is? It is precisely -- the theory of national economy. What are horn-rimmed spectacles? Spectacles with a horn-rim. What is a pack-ass? An ass on which burdens are packed. An extremely simple procedure, in fact, for explaining to little children the use of compound words. The only trouble is that anyone who does not already know the meaning of the words in question will be none the wiser, no matter which way round the words are placed.

Let us turn to another German scholar, who currently teaches political economy at the University of Berlin, a luminary of official science famous "far across the land, down to the blue sea," in other words Professor [Gustav von] Schmoller. In the great collective work of German professors edited by Professors [Johannes] Conrad and [Wilhelm] Lexis, _Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften_ [Concise Dictionary of the Political Sciences], Schmoller gives the following answer to the question what this science might be, in an essay on economic theory:

>I would say that it is the science that seeks to describe, define, and explain in causal terms national economic phenomena as a coherent whole, which naturally presupposes that national economy has already been correctly defined. At the center of this science stand those phenomena of division and organization of labor, of commerce and the distribution of income, of social economic institutions, supported by particular forms of private and public law, that are typically found among present-day civilized peoples, and that, controlled by the same or similar mental forces, produce similar or identical arrangements or forces, presenting in their total description a statics of the present economic civilized world, a kind of average constellation. Starting from this point, the science has gone on to investigate the differences between particular national economies, the various forms of organization here and there, and thus to inquire as to the combination and series in which these different forms emerge, and has in this way come to the notion of a causal development of forms and a historical succession of economic conditions; it has thus added to the static treatment a dynamic one. And as, from its first appearance, it already came by way of ethical-historical value judgments to the positing of ideals, it has continued to maintain this practical function to a certain degree. Alongside theory, it has posited practical lessons for life.

Phew! Let's pause for breath. What was all that? Social economic arrangements -- private and public law -- mental forces -- similar and the same -- the same and similar -- statistics -- statics -- dynamics -- average constellation -- causal development -- ethical-historical value judgments ... For ordinary mortals, this has the same numbing effect as a millwheel turning in the brain. In his insistent drive for knowledge, and his blind confidence in the spring of professorial wisdom, he makes the painful effort of going through the whole nonsense twice and three times, trying to extract some conceivable meaning. Unfortunately this is all needless trouble. What we're offered is precisely nothing but echoing phrases, hollow words screwed together. An unmistakable sign of this is that anyone who thinks clearly, and has a genuine mastery of his subject matter, also expresses himself clearly and understandably. Someone who expresses himself in obscure and high-flown terms, if he is not a pure philosophical idea-constructor or a fantasist of religious mysticism, only shows that he is himself unclear about the matter, or has reason to avoid clarity. We shall go on to show that the obscure and confusing language of bourgeois scholars as to the nature of political economy is not accidental, but actually expresses two things: both the unclearness of these gentlemen themselves, and their tendentious, stubborn rejection of a real explanation of the question.

That the clear definition of the nature of political economy is indeed a contentious question is suggested by a certain external circumstance. This is the fact that the most contradictory views are expressed as to the _age_ of this science. For example, the late Adolphe Blanqui -- a well-known historian and professor of political economy at the University of Paris, and brother of the famous socialist leader and Commune fighter Auguste Blanqui -- started the first chapter of his _History of Political Economy_, published in 1837, with the following epigraph: "Political economy is older than people think. The Greeks and the Romans already had their own." Other writers on the history of political economy, however, for instance the former _Dozent_ at the University of Berlin, Eugen Dühring, consider it important to stress that political economy is much younger than people generally believe: according to them, this science only properly arose in the second half of the eighteenth century.

To cite socialist judgments on this question, Lassalle in the preface to his classic polemical text of 1864 against Schulze-Delitzsch, _Kapital und Arbeit_ [Capital and Labor], made the following assertion: "Political economy is a science that is only at its beginnings and still to be constructed." Karl Marx, for his part, gave the first volume of his economic masterwork _Capital_ that appeared three years later, representing the fulfillment of the expectation expressed by Lassalle, the subtitle "Critique of Political Economy." In this way, Marx placed his own work outside the previous political economy, considering this as something confined and superseded, and setting out to criticize it. It is clear that a science that one lot of people maintain is almost as old as the written history of humanity, a second lot that it is scarcely a century and a half old, a third lot that it is still in diapers, and others again that it has already run its course and the time has come for its critical burial -- it is clear that such a science presents a rather peculiar and tangled problem.

We would receive equally poor advice if we were to ask one of the official representatives of this science to explain the remarkable fact that political economy, as currently prevailing opinion holds, only arose so late, scarcely a hundred and fifty years ago. Professor Dühring, for example, in a great flood of words, argues that the ancient Greeks and Romans had scarcely any scientific notion of political-economic matters, only "unsound," "superficial," "most commonplace" ideas taken from everyday experience, while the whole of the Middle Ages was extremely "unscientific." Which learned explanation does not take us a single step forward, not to mention the fact that it is also quite misleading, particularly in its generalization about the Middle Ages.

A different original explanation is offered by Professor Schmoller. In the same essay that we cited above from the _Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften_, he tells us:

>For several centuries, individual private and social economic facts were observed and described, individual truths of national economy recognized, and economic questions discussed in systems of ethics and law. These relevant individual parts could only be united when questions of national economy acquired previously unsuspected importance for the ruling and administration of states, from the seventeenth through to the nineteenth century, when numerous writers concerned themselves with them and instruction of students in them became necessary, while at the same time the rise of scientific thinking in general led to the accumulated propositions and truths of national economy being combined, by way of certain fundamental ideas -- such as money and exchange, state economic policy, labor and the division of labor -- into connected systems, as was attempted by major writers of the eighteenth century. Since this time, national economic theory or political economy has existed as an independent science.

If we briefly summarize this long speech, we obtain the lesson: individual political-economic observations, which existed as separate facts for a long while, came together in a particular science when this was required for the "ruling and administration of states" -- i.e. governments -- and it became necessary for this purpose to teach political economy in universities. What a wonderful and classic explanation from a German professor! First a chair is founded, when this is "required" by the praiseworthy government, to be occupied by an assiduous professor; then of course the corresponding science has also to be created, otherwise what could the professor teach? Doesn't this remind us of the master of court ceremonies who maintained that there would always have to be monarchies, otherwise what would be the function of a master of ceremonies? For the basic contention here is indeed that political economy came into being because the governments of modern states needed this science. The command of the powers that be is the genuine birth certificate of political economy. It is completely in character with the way of thinking of a present-day professor who, as scientific valet of the Reich government of the day, agitates "scientifically" as need arises for certain naval, customs or tax proposals, or as a battlefield hyena preaches chauvinist national hatred and intellectual cannibalism during a war -- it is completely in character to imagine that the financial needs of princes, the interests of "royal treasuries," a word of command from governments, is all that is needed to conjure a new science out of the ground. For the rest of humanity, however, those not paid out of the exchequer, such a notion has its difficulties. Above all, this explanation only raises a new puzzle. For we then have to ask: what happened so that around the seventeenth century, as Professor Schmoller maintains, the governments of modern states suddenly felt a need to dupe their dear subjects according to scientific principles, whereas for countless centuries they had managed quite successfully in the old-fashioned way, without such principles? Should we not turn all this upside down and see the new-fangled needs of "royal treasuries" as simply a modest consequence of that great historical transformation out of which the new science of political economy arose around the middle of the nineteenth century?

In brief, after failing to learn from this learned guild what political economy actually deals with, we do not even know when and why it arose.

### 1.2

One thing, at any rate, is established: in all the definitions of bourgeois specialists we have cited above, it is always a question of "national economy." And "political economy" is only a foreign word for the theory of national economy. The concept of national economy stands at the center of discussion for all official representatives of this science. What then actually is this national economy? Professor Bücher, whose work _Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft_ [The Rise of the National Economy] enjoys a high reputation both in Germany and abroad, offers the following information:

>The national economy is formed by the totality of arrangements, dispositions and procedures that the satisfaction of the needs of an entire nation demands. This national economy, again, breaks down into numerous particular economies, which are connected with one another by trade, and dependent on one another in a variety of ways as a result of the fact that each undertakes particular tasks for all the others and has the others undertake such tasks for it.

Let us try to translate this learned "definition" into the language of ordinary mortals.

If the first thing we hear is the "_totality_ of dispositions and procedures" that are designed to satisfy the needs of an entire nation, we are forced to consider everything possible: factories and workshops, agriculture and stock-raising, railways and warehouses, but also church preaching and police surveillance, ballet performances, civil servants and observatories, parliamentary elections, national guards and military associations, chess clubs, dog shows and duels -- for all these and an endless chain of other "dispositions and procedures" serve today to "satisfy the needs of an entire nation." The national economy would then be everything that takes place under the sun, and political economy a universal science "of all things and more," as the Latin tag goes.

The generous definition of the Leipzig professor evidently has to be restricted somewhat. Very likely he only wants to refer to "arrangements and procedures" that serve to satisfy the _material_ needs of a nation, or more precisely, the satisfaction of such needs by material things. And even then the "totality" would be far too widely conceived, and easily float off again into the mist. Yet we shall try to find our way here as best we can.

People all need, in order to live, food and drink, a protecting roof, clothing in cold regions, as well as all kind of articles of daily use in the home. These things may be simpler or more refined, be supplied sparingly or abundantly, but they are indispensable for the existence of any human society and must consequently be constantly produced by people -- we are not in the land of Cockaigne. In every kind of culture, as well, there are all kinds of objects that serve to improve life and satisfy intellectual and social needs, such as weapons for defense against enemies: among the so-called savages, dance masks, bows and arrows and idols; for us, luxury goods, churches, machine-guns and submarines. The production of all these articles requires, in turn, various natural materials, as well as the various tools with which they are produced. These materials, too, such as stones, wood, metal, plants etc., are obtained from the earth by human labor, and the tools that are used in this connection are likewise the product of human labor.

If this rough-hewn notion is temporarily satisfactory, we could conceive the national economy as follows: each nation constantly creates by its own labor a mass of things that are necessary for life -- food, clothing, buildings, household articles, jewelry, weapons, religious objects, etc. -- using the materials and tools that are indispensable for their production. The way in which a nation performs all this labor, how it distributes the goods produced among its individual members, how it consumes them and produces them afresh in an endless cycle -- all this together forms the economy of the people in question, a "national economy." This would then be more or less the meaning of the first sentence in Professor Bücher's definition. But we have to go into rather more detail.

"This national economy, again, breaks down into numerous particular economies, which are connected with one another by trade, and dependent on one another in a variety of ways as a result of the fact that each undertakes particular tasks for all and has others undertake such tasks for it." Here we come up against a new question: What are these "particular economies" that the "national economy," which we have taken pains to conceive properly, breaks down into? The first thing that suggests itself would be individual households, family economies. Indeed, each nation in the so-called civilized countries does consist of a number of families, and each family as a rule also conducts its "economy." This private economy consists in the family obtaining certain monetary incomes, whether from the employment of its adult members or from other sources, with which it in turn meets its needs for food, clothing, housing, etc.; and in this connection, if we think of a family economy, it is usually the housewife, the kitchen, the wash-tub and the nursery that form the center of this notion. Are these then the "individual economies" into which the "national economy" breaks down? We get into a certain confusion here. The national economy, as we have just understood it, involves first and foremost the production of all those goods that are used as food, clothing, housing, furniture, tools and materials for life and labor. At the center of the national economy stands _production_. In family economies, on the other hand, we see only the _consumption_ of the objects that the family obtains ready-made out of its income. We know that most families in modern states today buy almost all their foodstuffs, clothing, furniture, etc. ready-made from shops or markets. In the domestic economy meals are prepared only with bought foodstuffs, and clothes generally made from bought material. Only in very backward rural districts are there still peasant families who provide for most of their needs by their own household work. Of course there are on the other hand, even in modern states, many families who do produce various industrial products at home, such as domestic weavers and garment workers; there are even, as we know, whole villages where toys and similar things are produced on a mass scale domestically. But here the product manufactured by these families belongs exclusively to the entrepreneur who ordered it and paid for it; not the slightest part of it goes into their own consumption, into the economy of the home-working family. For their own household economy, these domestic workers buy everything ready-made out of their meager wages, in the same way as other families. Bücher's statement that the national economy breaks down into many individual economies would thus lead to something like the following result: the production of the means of existence of a whole nation "breaks down" simply into the _consumption_ of means of subsistence by individual families -- a statement that looks much like utter nonsense.

An additional doubt also arises. According to Professor Bücher, these "individual economies" are "connected with one another by exchange" and completely dependent on one another because "each undertakes particular tasks for all others." What kind of exchange and dependence does this mean? Is it for example exchange between friends and neighbors, of the kind that takes place between various private families? But what does such exchange actually have to do with the national economy, with the economy as a whole? Any capable housewife, indeed, will maintain that it is better for the household and for domestic peace that as little exchange as possible takes place between neighbors in different houses. And as to precisely what this "dependence" involves, it is impossible to see what "tasks" the household economy of pensioner Meyer is supposed to undertake for the household economy of headmaster Schulze and "all others." We have clearly taken a completely wrong turn here, and have to tackle the question from a different direction.

It evidently cannot be individual family households into which Professor Bücher's "national economy" breaks down. Shouldn't it rather be such things as factories, workshops, and agricultural holdings? One fact seems to confirm that this leads us onto the correct path. All these businesses are where various things really are produced and manufactured that serve the maintenance of the whole nation, while on the other hand there is real exchange and mutual dependence among them. A factory making trouser buttons, for example, is completely reliant on the tailoring workshops where it finds outlets for its goods, while the tailors in turn can't produce proper trousers without buttons. On the other hand, the tailoring workshops need materials, and this makes them reliant on the weavers of cotton and wool, who in turn depend on sheep-rearing and the cotton trade, etc., etc. Here we really can see a ramified connection of production. It is of course rather pompous to speak of "tasks" that each of these businesses "undertakes for all others," when what we have is the most ordinary sale of trouser buttons to tailors, of wool to spinning plants, and the like. But we have to accept such flowery language as unavoidable professorial jargon, as they love to wrap the profitable little deals of the business world in a bit of poetry and "ethical value judgments," as Professor Schmoller so nicely puts it. It is just that still more serious doubts arise at this point. The individual factories, agricultural holdings, coalmines and iron works are said to be so many "individual economies" into which the national economy "breaks down." But this concept of an "economy," at least as we have now conceived the national economy, must evidently include within a certain orbit both the manufacture of means of subsistence and their use, both production and consumption. In these factories, workshops, mines and plants, however, only production takes place, and indeed only for others. What are consumed here are only the materials and tools that are needed for labor. The finished product, for its part, in no way enters into consumption within the same business. Not a single trouser button is consumed by the manufacturer and his family, let alone by the factory workers, nor are iron tubes consumed by the iron-works proprietor's family. Besides, if we try to define the "economy" more closely, we must always understand by it something whole, to a certain extent entire unto itself, more or less the production and consumption of the most important means of subsistence required for human existence. Today's individual industrial and agricultural businesses, however, as every child knows, only produce a single product, or at most a few products, which would be far from sufficient for human maintenance, most of these moreover being not at all consumable, just one part of a food product, or a raw material or tool needed for this. Present-day production facilities are precisely just fragments of an economy, having no meaning and purpose of their own in economic terms, so that they immediately strike even the untutored eye as not forming any "economy" by themselves, but only a shapeless little splinter of an economy. So if we say that the national economy, i.e. the totality of arrangements and procedures that serve to satisfy the needs of a people, breaks down again into individual economies, which are factories, workshops, mines, etc., we could equally well say that the totality of biological arrangements that serve to perform the functions of the human organism is the human being itself, which breaks down again into several individual organisms that are the nose, ears, legs, arms, etc. The present-day factory, in fact, is no more an "individual economy" than the nose is an individual organism.

This route too thus leads to an absurdity -- proof that the artful definitions of bourgeois scholars, constructed simply on the basis of external characteristics and word-splitting, have an evident reason in this case to circumvent the true heart of the matter.

Let us now attempt to subject the concept of national economy to a closer examination.

### 1.3

We are told about the needs of a nation, about the satisfaction of these needs in an interconnected economy, and in this way about the economy of a nation. Political economy would then be the science that explains to us the nature of this national economy, i.e. the laws according to which a nation creates and increases its wealth by labor, distributes this among individuals, consumes it and creates it afresh. The object of the investigation should thus be the economic life of a whole nation, in contrast with a private or individual economy, whatever the latter might mean. It appears to confirm this notion that the epoch-making book published in 1776 by Adam Smith, who is seen as the father of political economy, bore the title _The Wealth of Nations_.

The first thing we must ask, however, is whether there really is such a thing as the economy of a nation. Do nations each conduct a separate household, a closed economic life? Since the expression "national economy" is especially popular in Germany, let us turn our attention to this country.

The hands of German workers, male and female, produce each year tremendous quantities of all kinds of useful products. But is all this produced just for the use of the population living in the German Empire? We know that an enormous proportion of German products, growing every year, is dispatched to other countries and parts of the world, for the use of other nations. German iron products go to various neighboring European countries, and further afield to South America and Australia; leather and leather goods go from Germany to all European states; glass products, sugar and gloves find their way to England; animal hides to France, England and Austria-Hungary; the dye-stuff alizarin to England, the United States and India; phosphates for artificial fertilizer to the Netherlands and Austria-Hungary; coke to France; coal to Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland; electrical cable to England, Sweden and Belgium; toys to the United States; German beer, indigo, aniline and other coal-tar dyes, German pharmaceuticals, cellulose, gold articles, stockings, cotton and woolen materials and clothes, and German locomotive rails are dispatched to almost all trading countries across the world.

Conversely, however, the German people are reliant at every turn in their labor, as well as in daily consumption, on products of other countries and nations. We eat bread from Russian wheat and meat from Hungarian, Danish and Russian cattle; the rice that we consume comes from the East Indies and North America, tobacco from the Dutch East Indies and Brazil; we receive cocoa beans from West Africa, pepper from India; lard from the United States; tea from China; vegetables from Italy, Spain and the United States; coffee from Brazil, Central America and the Dutch East Indies; meat extract from Uruguay; eggs from Russia, Hungary and Bulgaria; cigars from the island of Cuba; pocket watches from Switzerland; sparkling wine from France; cattle hides from Argentina; feathers for beds from China; silk from Italy and France: flax and hemp from Russia; cotton from the United States, India and Egypt; fine wool from England; jute from India; malt from Austria-Hungary; linseed from Argentina; certain kinds of coal from England; lignite from Austria; nitre from Chile; quebracho for tanning from Argentina; construction timber from Russia; cork from Portugal; copper from the United States; tin from the Dutch East Indies; zinc from Australia; aluminum from Austria-Hungary and Canada; asbestos from Canada; asphalt and marble from Italy; cobblestones from Sweden; lead from Belgium, the United States and Australia; graphite from Ceylon, phosphoric lime from America and Algeria; iodine from Chile ...

From the simplest foodstuff eaten every day to the most sought-after luxury goods and the materials and tools needed for them, the greater part come directly or indirectly from foreign countries, entirely or in one or other component, and are the product of other people's labor. To make our life and work possible in Germany, we have almost all other countries, peoples and parts of the world work for us, and we work in turn for all these countries.

In order to get an idea of the enormous scope of this exchange, let us cast a glance at the official statistics for imports and exports. According to the _Statistisches Jahrbuch für das Deutsche Reich_ [Statistical Yearbook of the German Empire], 1914 edition, Germany's total trade (net of goods arriving in Germany for re-export) was as follows.

Germany imported in 1913:

* Raw materials: to the value of 5,262 million marks
* Semi-finished products: 1,246 million marks
* Finished products: 1,776 million marks
* Foodstuffs and consumer goods: 3,063 million marks
* Live animals: 289 million marks

In total, 11,63815 million marks, or close to 12 thousand million.

In the same year, Germany exported:

* Raw materials: 1,720 million marks
* Semi-finished products: 1,159 million marks
* Finished products: 6,642 million marks
* Foodstuffs and consumer goods: 1,362 million marks
* Live animals: 7 million marks

In total, 10,891 million marks or nearly 11 billion marks. Germany's annual foreign trade thus amounts to more than 22 billion marks.

The situation is the same, to a greater or lesser extent, in other modern states, precisely those with which political economy has been exclusively concerned. All these countries produce for one another, partly even for the most far-flung parts of the world, while likewise consuming all along the line products from all other parts of the world.

In the light of such a tremendously developed reciprocal exchange, how are we to draw the borders between the "economy" of one nation and that of another? Should we speak of so many "national economies" as if these could be treated as separate territories in economic terms?

Of course, the increasing international exchange of goods is no new discovery, unknown to bourgeois scholars. Official statistical surveys and their annually published reports have long since made the facts reported the common property of all educated people; businessmen and industrial workers, moreover, know them from their daily life. The fact of rapidly increasing world trade is so universally known and recognized today that it can no longer be challenged or doubted. But how is this question conceived by the academic specialists in political economy? As a purely external chance connection, as the export of a so-called "surplus" in the products of one country over and above its own needs and the import of what is "lacking" in its own economy -- a connection that in no way prevents them from continuing to speak as before of the "national economy" and "national-economic theory."

Professor Bücher, for example, proclaims, after he has lectured us at length about the present-day "national economy" as the highest and final stage of development in the series of historical economic forms:

>It would be a mistake to conclude from the successful easing of international trade in the liberal age that the era of national economy is on the decline and making way for an era of world economy ... We certainly see today in Europe a series of states that renounce national autonomy in their provision of goods to the extent that they are forced to obtain considerable quantities of their food and consumer goods from abroad, while their industrial production capacity has grown far beyond the national need and supplies regular surpluses that have to seek their utilization in foreign lands. But the existence alongside one another of such industrial and raw-material producing countries that are mutually reliant, this "international division of labor," should not be taken as a sign that humanity is on the brink of reaching a new stage of development, and be opposed to earlier stages under the name of a _world economy_. For, on the one hand, no economic stage has guaranteed complete ability to satisfy its own needs in the long term; each leaves certain gaps, which have had to be filled in one way or another. On the other hand, at least up to this time, no signs of this so-called world economy have yet appeared that depart from those of the national economy in their essential characteristics, and it is very doubtful whether such will appear in the foreseeable future.

Still bolder is Professor Bücher's younger colleague [Werner] Sombart, who declares point-blank that we are not moving into a world economy, but on the contrary increasingly departing from this:

>The civilized peoples, I would rather maintain, are today (as far as their overall economy goes) not fundamentally more, but rather less linked with one another by trading relations. The individual national economy today is not more but actually less involved in the world market than a hundred or fifty years ago. At least ... it would be wrong to assume that international trade relations are acquiring a relatively growing importance for the modern national economy. The opposite is the case.

Professor Sombart is convinced that "individual national economies are becoming ever more complete microcosms [i.e. small closed worlds -- R.L.] and that the internal market increasingly overshadows the world market in importance for all lines of trade."

This blatant foolishness, which recklessly flies in the face of all daily perceptions of economic life, most happily underlines the stubborn reluctance of the gentlemen of the scholarly guild to recognize the world economy as a new phase of development of human society -- a reluctance that it is well worthwhile to note, and whose hidden roots we shall go on to examine.

So, because at "earlier economic stages," for example at the time of King Nebuchadnezzar, "certain gaps" in people's economic life were filled by exchange, _present-day_ world trade has nothing to teach us, and we still have a "national economy." That is Professor Bücher's opinion.

How indicative this is about the crude historical conception of a scholar whose fame is based precisely on supposedly acute and deep insights into economic history! With the help of a fatuous schema, he brings the international trade of the most varied stages of economy and civilization, separated by millennia, under a single category. Of course there never has been any social form without exchange, and there is not today. The oldest prehistoric discoveries, the most primitive caves used as dwellings by "antediluvian" human beings, the most primitive graves from early times, all give evidence of a certain exchange of products already between distant regions. Exchange is as old as human culture itself, it has ever been a constant accompaniment of this and its most powerful promoter. In this general knowledge, quite vague in its generality, our scholar now drowns all particularities of different eras, levels of civilization and economic forms. Just as all cats are grey in the dark, so in the obscurity of this professorial theory all forms of exchange, no matter how diverse, are one and the same. The primitive exchange of an Amerindian tribe in Brazil, who every now and then happen to exchange their uniquely woven dance masks for the artfully made bows and arrows of another tribe; the gleaming warehouses of Babylon, where the splendors of Oriental court life were accumulated; the ancient market of Corinth, where at the new moon Oriental cloth, Greek pottery, paper from Tyre, Syrian and Anatolian slaves were offered for sale to rich slave-owners; the medieval maritime trade of Venice, supplying luxury goods to European feudal courts and patrician houses -- and the present-day capitalist world trade, which has brought East and West, North and South, all the oceans and corners of the world into its net, and year in, year out moves tremendous quantities of goods hither and thither -- from the beggar's daily bread and firewood through to the artworks most sought after by rich connoisseurs, from the simplest fruit of the soil through to the most complicated tool, from human labor-power, the source of all wealth, through to the deadly instruments of war -- all this is one and the same for our professor of political economy: simply the "filling" of "certain gaps" in the independent economic organism! ...

Fifty years ago, Schulze von Delitsch taught the German workers that each person nowadays first of all produced for himself, but "those products he does not need himself ... he exchanges for the products of others." Lassalle's response to him remains unforgettable:

>Herr Patrimonialrichter Schulze! Have you no idea at all about the real pattern of social labor today? Didn't you come from Bitterfeld and Delitzsch? In what century of the Middle Ages are you still living with these ideas? ... Have you no inkling that social labor today is precisely characterized by the fact that each person produces precisely what he cannot use himself? Have you no inkling that this has to be so, ever since the rise of modern industry, that the form and essence of present-day labor lies in this, and that without the sharpest emphasis on this point it is impossible to understand a single page of our present-day economic conditions, not a single one of our present-day economic phenomena?

>According to you, then, Herr Leonor Reichenheim in Wüste-Giersdorf produces first of all the cotton yarn that he needs for himself. The surplus, which his daughters cannot work up into more stockings and nightshirts for him, he exchanges.
>
>Herr Borsig first of all produces machines for his family's needs. He then sells the surplus machines.
>
>The workshops making mourning clothes provide first of all for deaths in their own families. But if there are too few of these, and some mourning clothes are left over, they exchange them.
>
>Herr Wolff, proprietor of the local telegraph office, first has messages come in for his own instruction and pleasure. And when he's had his fill, if there are any left over, he exchanges them with the stock-exchange sharks and newspaper editorial offices against their surplus newspaper reports and shares! ...

>In conclusion, it is precisely the distinctive character of labor in _earlier_ periods of society, to be sharply emphasized, that at this time people produced first of all for their own needs and parted with the surplus, i.e. they principally pursued a natural economy.
>
>And it is again the distinctive character, the specific determination of labor in _modern_ society, that each produces only what he in no way does need, i.e. that everyone produces exchange-values, whereas previously they produced use-values.
>
>And do you not understand, Herr Schulze, that this is the necessary "form and manner of performing labor," ever more prevailing, in a society in which the division of labor has developed to such a degree as it has in modern society?

What Lassalle tried here to explain to Schulze about capitalist private enterprise applies more each day now to the economic pattern of highly developed capitalist countries such as England, Germany, Belgium or the United States, in whose footsteps the others are following one after the other. And the attempt by the progressive patrician from Bitterfeld to mislead the workers was only more naive, but no cruder, than the tendentious arguments of a Bücher or Sombart against the concept of a world economy today.

Punctilious civil servant that he is, the German professor loves proper order. For the sake of order, he also likes to arrange the world nicely into the pigeon-holes of a scientific schema. And in the same way as he places his books on the shelves, so he has also divided the different countries onto two shelves: on the one hand, countries that produce industrial goods and have "a surplus" of these; on the other, countries that pursue agriculture and stock-raising and whose products meet a shortage in other lands. This is how international trade arises, and what it is based on.

Germany is the one of the most industrialized countries in the world. According to this schema, its most vigorous trade should be with a large agricultural country such as Russia. How is it then that Germany's most important trading partners are the two other most industrialized countries: the United States and Britain? Germany's trade with the United States in 1913 amounted to 2,400 million marks, and with Britain to 2,300 million; Russia only came in third place. And especially as regards exports, the leading industrial state in the world is precisely the greatest customer for German industry: with 1,400 million marks' worth of annual imports from Germany, England stands in first position, leaving all other countries far behind. The British Empire, including its colonies, takes a good fifth of German exports. What does the professorial schema say about this remarkable phenomenon?

Here industrial countries, there agricultural ones -- that is the rigid skeleton of world economic relations with which Professor Bücher and most of his colleagues operate. Back in the 1860s, however, Germany was an agricultural country; it had a surplus of agricultural products and had to obtain the most necessary industrial goods from England. Since then, it has also been transformed into an industrial country, and the most powerful rival to England. The United States is doing the same as Germany did in the 1870s and 80s, in a yet briefer interval; it is already well along this path. America is still one of the largest grain-producing countries in the world, along with Russia, Canada, Australia and Romania, and according to its last census (which dates from 1900) as many as 36 percent of its total population is still employed in agriculture. At the same time, however, the country's industry is striding forward at an unmatched speed, so that it presents a dangerous contender to England and Germany. We could set up a prize competition for our great faculties of political economy to define whether the United States, in Professor Bücher's schema, should be classified as an agricultural state or an industrial one. Russia is slowly following on the same path, and as soon as it casts off the fetters of an obsolete form of state it will catch up, thanks to its tremendous population and inexhaustible natural wealth, and appear in our own lifetimes alongside Germany, England and the United States as a powerful industrial country, if it does not indeed overshadow them. The world is precisely not a rigid skeleton, unlike the wisdom of a professor; it is living, moving and changing. The polar opposition between industry and agriculture, from which international exchange is supposed to emerge, is thus itself something fleeting; it will steadily shift ever more from the center of the modern civilized world to its periphery. What is happening meanwhile with trade within this ambit of civilization? According to Bücher's theory it should steadily dwindle. But instead -- a miracle! -- trade is growing ever greater between the industrial countries themselves.

Nothing is more instructive than the picture that the development of our modern economic region offers in the last quarter of a century. Despite the fact that there have been real orgies of tariff raising in all the industrial countries and major states of Europe, as also in America, i.e. mutual artificial barriers to "national economies," world trade has not stopped developing in this period -- it has pursued a furious course. And that increasing industrialization and world trade go hand in hand, even a blind person can see from the example of the three leading countries: England, Germany and the United States.

Coal and iron form the core of modern industry. Coal production from 1885 to 1910 rose as follows:

* in England from 162 to 269 million tons
* in Germany from 74 to 222 million tons
* in the United States from 101 to 455 million tons

Pig iron production rose in the same period

* in England from 7.5 to 10.2 million tons
* in Germany from 3.7 to 14.8 million tons
* in the United States from 4.1 to 27.7 million tons

At the same time, annual foreign trade (imports and exports) rose from 1882 to 1912

* in England from 13,000 to 27,400 million marks
* in Germany from 6,200 to 21,300 million marks
* in the United States from 5,500 to 16,200 million marks

If however we take the total foreign trade (imports and exports) of _all_ the more important countries on earth in recent years, this rose from 105,000 million marks in 1904 to 165,000 million in 1912. That means a growth of 57 percent in eight years! There is not even a close parallel to this breath-taking pace of economic development in the whole of previous world history -- "the dead ride swiftly." The capitalist "national economy" seems in a hurry to exhaust the limits of its capacity, to shorten the remission period in which it can justify its existence. And what does the schema of "certain gaps" and the clumsy dance between industrial and agricultural countries have to say about this?

Yet there is no longer such a puzzle in modern economic life.

Let us take a closer look at the tables for German imports and exports, instead of resting content with total sums of goods exchanged or their major economic categories; let us examine as an experiment the most important kinds of German trade.

Two facts immediately strike the most superficial observer. The first is that in several cases one and the same type of commodity figures in _both_ columns, even if in different quantities. Germany sends enormous quantities of machinery abroad, but it also imports machinery from abroad to the considerable annual sum of 80 million marks. Likewise, coal is exported from Germany while at the same time foreign coal is imported into Germany. The same holds for cotton goods, woolen yarn and finished goods, also for hides and skins, and many other goods that are not included in this table. From the standpoint of a crude opposition between industry and agriculture, which our professor of political economics uses like Aladdin's lamp to illuminate all the secrets of modern world trade, this remarkable duplication is quite incomprehensible; it even appears completely absurd. What is happening here? Has Germany a "surplus over and above its own needs," or on the contrary "certain gaps"? Both in coal and in cotton goods? And in cattle hides? And a hundred more! Or is a "national economy" supposed always to show some kind of "surplus" and "certain gaps"? Aladdin's lamp is flickering insecurely. Clearly the observed facts can only be explained if we assume that there exist more complicated and far-reaching economic connections between Germany and other countries, a ramified and detailed division of labor that allows for certain kinds of the same products to be produced in Germany for other countries, other kinds abroad for Germany, creating a continuous to and fro in which individual countries appear only as organic parts of a greater whole.

Besides, anyone must be struck at first glance in the table above by the fact that imports and exports do not appear here as two separate phenomena in need of explanation, on the one hand by "gaps" in a country's own economy, on the other by its "surpluses," but that they are instead linked causally together. Germany's tremendous cotton import is quite evidently not the result of its population's own needs, but is rather designed from the start to make possible the great export of cotton goods and clothing from Germany. Likewise, the connection between the import of wool and the export of woolen goods, and between the tremendous import of iron from abroad and the tremendous export of iron goods of every shape and form, and so on. Thus Germany imports in order to be able to export. It does not artificially create "certain gaps" so as to subsequently transform these gaps into as many "surpluses." The German "microcosm" thus appears from the start, in all its dimensions, as a fragment of a greater whole, as a single workshop in the world.

But let us examine this "microcosm" rather more closely, in its "ever
more perfect" self-satisfaction. Let us imagine that by some kind of
social and political catastrophe the German "national economy" were
actually cut off from the rest of the world and left to its own devices.
What picture would this then present?

Let us start with the daily bread. German agriculture has twice as high
a yield as that of the United States; in terms of quality it holds first
place among the world's agricultural countries, and it is only outdone
by the still more intensive cultivation of Belgium, Ireland and the
Netherlands. Fifty years ago, Germany with an agriculture that was then
far more backward was one of the granaries of Europe; it fed other
countries with the surplus of its own bread. Today, despite the higher
yield, German agriculture is not nearly sufficient to feed its own
people and its own cattle: a sixth of the foodstuffs needed have to be
obtained from abroad. In other words, if the German "national economy"
were to be cut off from the world, a sixth of the population, some 11
million Germans, would be deprived of their sustenance.

The German people spend 220 million marks each year on coffee, 67
million on cocoa, 8 million on tea, 61 million on rice; they spend at
least another 10 million marks on various spices, and 134 million on
imported tobacco. All these products, which even the poorest people
today cannot dispense with, which are part of everyday habit and
subsistence, are not produced in Germany at all (or, as in the case of
tobacco, only in small quantities), since the German climate is unsuited
to them. If Germany were to be permanently closed off from the world
economy, the subsistence of the German people, which corresponds to its
present level of civilization, would collapse.

Let us turn from food to clothing. Both the underwear and the outer
clothing of the broad mass of people are today made entirely from
cotton, the underwear of the richer bourgeoisie from linen and their
outer garments from fine wool and silk. Neither cotton nor silk are
produced in Germany at all, and no more is the highly important textile
jute or the finest wool, Britain having a world monopoly on these;
Germany also has a great shortfall in hemp and flax. If Germany were
permanently cut off from the world, both raw materials from abroad and
outlets for exports would disappear, and all classes of the German
people would be deprived of their most essential clothing; the Germany
textile industry, which together with the clothing industry today
provides a livelihood for 1,400,000 adult and juvenile workers of both
sexes, would be ruined.

We can go on. The backbone of today's large-scale industry is what is
known as heavy industry, i.e. machine production and metallurgy; and the
backbone of these is metal ore. In 1913, Germany consumed some 17
million tons of pig iron. Its own production of pig iron also amounts to
17 million tons. At first glance, it might look as if the German
"national economy" could cover its own needs in terms of iron. But the
production of pig iron requires iron ore, and we find that Germany's own
demand for iron ore alone amounts to some 27 million tons, a value of
more than 110 million marks, while 12 million tons of higher-quality
iron ore costing more than 200 million marks, ore without which the
German metal industry could not continue, is obtained from Sweden,
France and Spain.

The other metals present more or less the same picture. Against an
annual consumption of 220,000 tons of zinc, Germany produces 270,000
tons itself, out of which 100,000 tons is exported, while more than
50,000 tons of metal is obtained from abroad to cover its needs. The
zinc ore needed is again only partly obtained in Germany, some half a
million tons to the value of 50 million marks. 300,000 tons of
higher-quality ores costing 40 million marks have to be imported. With
lead, Germany imports 94,000 tons of finished metal and 123,000 tons of
ore. And with copper, finally, German production with an annual
consumption of 241,000 tons depends on imports from abroad for as much
as 206,000 tons. Tin, for its part, is completely obtained from abroad.
If Germany were cut off from the world for an extended period, the basis
for the existence of German metal production, which employs 662,000
workers, along with the machine industry that provides a living for
1,130,000 workers of both sexes, would disappear consequent on the
supply of the most valuable metals, along with the enormous outlet
abroad for German iron products and machinery. And a whole series of
other branches of production that depend on these raw materials and
tools, such as those supplying them with raw and ancillary materials,
would collapse along with the metal and machine industries, for example
coal mining, as well as those that produce means of subsistence for the
immense armies of workers in these branches of industry.

We should also mention the chemical industry with its 168,000 workers,
which produces for the entire world. Likewise the wood industry, which
employs 450,000 workers today, but which would have to close down most
of its operations without foreign timber and construction wood. Also the
leather industry, which in the absence of foreign hides as well as the
large market it has abroad, would make its 117,000 workers redundant. We
should mention the precious metals gold and silver, which provide the
money material and are accordingly the indispensable foundation of all
present-day economic life, but which are scarcely produced at all in
Germany. Let us bear all this in mind, and then ask, what is this German
"national economy"? Assuming, in other words, that Germany were to be
really and permanently cut off from the rest of the world and had to
conduct its economy quite alone, what would become of present-day
economic life and along with it Germany's whole contemporary
civilization? One branch of production after another would collapse,
each in turn pulling the other down with it, a tremendous mass of
proletarians would find themselves without employment, the whole
population would be deprived of the most essential means of subsistence,
consumer goods and clothing, trade would be deprived of its foundation,
the precious money metal, and the entire "national economy" would become
a heap of rubble, a shattered wreck! ...

This is what these "certain gaps" in German economic life actually
amount to, and likewise the "ever more perfect microcosm" that
self-evidently floats in the blue ether of professorial theory.

But stop! What about the world war of 1914, the great experimental test
of the "national economy"? Has this not vindicated Bücher and Sombart
most convincingly? Has it not shown an envious world how excellently the
German "microcosm" remains capable of existence, healthy and powerful
even in hermetic isolation from world trade, thanks to sturdy state
organization and the performance of German technology? Hasn't the food
supply of the people been entirely met without foreign agriculture, and
haven't the wheels of industry kept moving despite foreign export
outlets?

Let us examine the facts.

Food supply, first of all. This was not remotely met by German
agriculture alone. Several million adult men in the army were supplied
for almost the whole duration of the war by foreign countries: Belgium,
northern France, and parts of Poland and Lithuania. To feed the German
people, therefore, the surface of its own "national economy" was
expanded by the whole area of the occupied regions of Belgium and
northern France, and in the second year of the war by the western part
of Russia, which had to meet a large part of the shortfall in German
provisioning out of its own agricultural production. An additional
counterpart to this was the lamentable deficit in the nutrition of the
domestic population of those foreign territories, which in turn --
Belgium is an example -- were supported by charity from the products of
American agriculture. A second additional factor was the rise in price
of all provisions in Germany by between 100 and 200 percent, and the
terrible malnutrition of the broadest strata of the domestic population.

Then there is industrial machinery. How could all this be kept going
without the supply of foreign raw materials and other means of
production, the tremendous scale of which we already know? How could
such a miracle happen? The solution to the riddle is extremely simple
and no miracle is involved. German industry could remain active simply
and solely because it was indeed continuously supplied with the
indispensable raw materials from abroad, which it obtained in three
ways: firstly from the large stocks that Germany already possessed of
cotton, wool, copper, etc., in various forms, and which only needed to
be taken out of their hiding places and made available; secondly, from
the stocks that it laid hands on in other countries: Belgium, northern
France, parts of Poland and Lithuania, by means of military occupation;
and thirdly, by the continuing supply from abroad, which by the
intermediary of neutral countries (and Luxembourg) did not stop right
through the whole of the war. If we add to this the fact that an
indispensable precondition of this entire "war economy" and its smooth
progress was also an enormous reserve of foreign precious metal
deposited in German banks, it turns out that the hermetic isolation of
German industry and trade from the rest of the world is just as much a
legend as is the adequate supply of the German population by domestic
agriculture, and that the supposed self-sufficiency of the German
"microcosm" during the World War was based on a couple of fairy-tales.

Finally, we come to the outlet for German industry, which we showed was
provided to such a high degree by all other parts of the world. For the
duration of the war this was replaced by the state's own military needs.
In other words, the most important branches of industry: metallurgy,
textiles, leather and chemicals, underwent remodeling and were
transformed exclusively into industries supplying the armed forces.
Since the costs of the war were borne by German tax-payers, this
transformation of industry into war industry meant that the German
"national economy," instead of sending a large part of its products for
exchange abroad, surrendered them to continuing destruction in the war,
burdening the future products of the economy for decades to come with
the loss arising, by way of the public credit system.

If we take all this into account, it is clear that the miraculous
success of this "microcosm" during the war represented in every respect
an experiment in which the only question was how long it could be
extended without the artificial construction collapsing like a house of
cards.

One further glance at a remarkable phenomenon: If we consider Germany's
foreign trade in its total amounts, it is striking that its imports are
significantly greater than its exports: the former amounted in 1913 to
11,600 million marks, the latter to 10,900 million. And this
relationship was in no way an exception for the year in question, but
can be noted for an extended number of years. The same holds for Great
Britain, which in 1913 showed imports to a total of 13,000 million marks
and exports to 10,000 million. How is such a phenomenon possible?
Perhaps Professor Bücher can explain it for us with his theory of the
"surplus" over a country's own needs and of "certain gaps."

If the economic relations between the different "national economies"
amount to no more than the fact that, as the professor teaches us, these
"national economies," just as at the time of Nebuchadnezzar, cast off
certain "surpluses," i.e. if simple commodity exchange is the only
bridge over the void dividing one of these "microcosms" from another, it
is clear that a country can import exactly as much in goods from abroad
as it exports of its own. But in simple commodity exchange money is only
an intermediary, and the foreign products are paid at the end of the day
in one's own commodities. How then can a "national economy" manage the
artifice of permanently importing more from abroad than it exports from
its own "surplus"? Perhaps the professor will jest with us that the
solution is the simplest thing in the world, the importing country only
needs to settle the excess of its imports over its exports in cash.
"Only," indeed! The luxury, year in year out, of filling the bottomless
pit of its foreign trade with a considerable sum of money that will
never be seen again is something that at most a country with rich gold
and silver mines of its own could afford, which is not the case with
either Germany or France, Belgium or the Netherlands. Besides, there is
a further amazing surprise: not only does Germany steadily import more
goods that it imports, it also imports more money! In 1913, German
imports of gold and silver came to 441.3 million marks, its exports to
102.8 million, a relationship that has been approximately the same for
years. What does Professor Bücher with his "surpluses" and "gaps" have
to say about this puzzle? The magic lamp is flickering gloomily. Indeed,
we begin to suspect that behind the puzzling character of world trade
there must in fact be quite other kinds of economic relations between
individual "national economies" than simple commodity exchange; to
regularly obtain from other countries more than you give them is
evidently only possible for a country that has some kind of economic
claim over others that is completely different from exchange between
equals. And such claims and relations of dependence between countries
exist in fact at every turn, although these professorial theories know
nothing of them. One such dependence relationship, in the simplest form,
is that between a so-called mother country and its colony. Great Britain
draws from its largest colony, India, an annual tribute of more than
1,000 million marks. And we accordingly see that India's exports of
goods are some 1,200 million marks greater than its imports. This
"surplus" is nothing more than the economic expression of the colonial
exploitation of India by British capitalism -- whether these goods are
directly bound for Great Britain, or whether India has to sell to other
states each year goods to a value of 1,200 million marks specifically
for the purpose of paying this tribute to its British exploiters. But
there are also other relationships of economic dependence that are not
based on political rule. Russia annually exports around 1,000 million
marks' worth more of goods than it imports. Is it the great "surplus" of
agricultural products over the needs of its own "national economy" that
drains this immense flow of goods each year out of the Russian Empire?
But the Russian peasant, whose corn is taken out of the country in this
way, is well known to suffer from scurvy due to undernourishment, and
often has to eat bread mixed with tree bark! The massive export of his
grain, through the mechanism of a financial and taxation system designed
for this purpose, is a matter of life or death for the Russian state, in
order to meet its obligations to foreign creditors. Since its notorious
defeat in the Crimean war, and its modernization by the reforms of
Alexander II, the Russian state apparatus has been financed to a high
degree by capital borrowed from Western Europe, principally from France.
In order to pay interest on the French loans, Russia has to sell each
year large quantities of wheat, timber, flax, hemp, cattle and poultry
to Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. The immense surplus of Russian
exports thus represents the tribute of a debtor to his creditors, a
relationship matched on the French side by a large surplus of imports,
which represents nothing other than the interest on its loan capital.
But in Russia itself, the chain of economic connections runs further.
The borrowed French capital has served principally in the last few
decades for two purposes: railway building with state guarantees, and
armaments. To this end, Russia has developed since the 1870s a strong
heavy industry -- under the protection of a system of high customs
tariffs. The borrowed capital from the old capitalist country France has
fueled a young capitalism in Russia, but this in turn requires for its
support and expansion a considerable import of machinery and other means
of production from Britain and Germany as the most technologically
advanced industrial countries. A tie of economic connections is thus
woven between Russia, France, Germany and Britain, in which commodity
exchange is only a small part.

Yet this does not exhaust the manifold nature of these connections. A
country like Turkey or China presents a new puzzle for our professor. It
has, contrary to Russia but similarly to Germany or France, a large
surplus of imports, amounting in many years to almost double the
quantity of exports. How can Turkey or China afford the luxury of such a
copious filling of the "gaps" in their "national economies," given that
these economies are not nearly in a position to export corresponding
"surpluses"? Do the Western powers offer the crescent and the realm of
the pigtail each year a present of several hundred million marks, in the
form of all kinds of useful goods, out of Christian charity? Every child
know that both Turkey and China are actually up to their necks in the
jaws of European usurers, and have to pay the British, German and French
banks an enormous tribute in interest. Following the Russian example,
both Turkey and China should on the contrary show a surplus of exports
of their own agricultural products in order to be able to pay this
interest to their West European well wishers. But in both these two
countries the so-called "national economy" is fundamentally different
from the Russian. Certainly, the foreign loans are likewise used
principally for railway building, port construction and armaments. But
Turkey has virtually no industry of its own, and cannot conjure this out
of the ground of its medieval peasant subsistence agriculture with its
primitive cultivation and tithes. The same is true in a slightly
different way for China. And so not only the whole of the population's
need for industrial goods, but also everything necessary for transport
construction and the equipment of army and navy, has to be imported
ready-made from Western Europe and constructed on site by European
entrepreneurs, technicians and engineers. The loans are indeed
frequently tied in advance to supplies of this kind. China, for example,
obtains a loan from German and Austrian banking capital only on
condition that it immediately orders a certain quantity of armaments
from the Skoda works and Krupp; other loans are tied in advance to
concessions for the construction of railways. In this way, most European
capital migrates to Turkey and China already in the form of goods
(armaments) or industrial capital in kind, in the form of machinery,
iron, etc. These latter goods are not sent for exchange, but for the
production of profit. Interest on this capital, along with further
profit, is squeezed from the Turkish or Chinese peasants by the European
capitalists with the help of a corresponding taxation system under
European financial control. The bare figures of a preponderance of
imports for Turkey or China, and corresponding European exports, thus
conceal the particular relationship that obtains between the rich
big-capitalist West and the poor and backward East that it bleeds dry
with the help of the most modern and developed communications facilities
and military installations -- and with it the galloping ruin of the old
peasant "national economy."

A still different case is presented by the United States. Here we again
see, as in Russia, an export figure well above that of imports -- the
former came to 10,200 million marks in 1913, the latter to 7,400 million
-- but the reasons for this are fundamentally different from the Russian
case. Right from the beginning of the nineteenth century, the London
stock exchange has absorbed vast quantities of American loans and
shares; speculation in American company formation and stocks, until the
1860s, regularly announced like a fever patient's thermometer an
impending major crisis for British industry and trade. Since then, the
outflow of English capital to the United States has not ceased. This
capital partly took the form of loan capital to cities and private
companies, but mostly that of industrial capital, whether American
railway and industrial stocks were sold on the London stock exchange, or
English industrial cartels founded branches in the US in order to
circumvent the high tariff barrier, or else to take over companies there
by purchasing their shares, in order to get rid of their competition on
the world market. The United States possesses today a highly developed
heavy industry that is advancing every more swiftly, and that, while it
continues to attract money capital from Europe, itself exports
industrial capital on an increasing scale -- machinery, coal -- to
Canada, Mexico and other Central and South American countries. In this
way the United States combines an enormous export of raw materials --
cotton, copper, wheat, timber and petroleum -- to the old capitalist
countries with a growing industrial export to the young countries
embarking on industrialization. The United States' great surplus of
exports thus reflects the particular transitional stage from a
capital-receiving agricultural country to a capital-exporting industrial
one, the role of an intermediate link between the old capitalist Europe
and the new and backward American continent.

An overview of this great migration of capital from the old industrial
countries to the young ones, and the corresponding reverse migration of
the incomes drawn from this capital and paid as annual tribute by the
young countries to the old, shows three powerful streams. England,
according to estimates from 1906, had already invested 54,000 million
marks by this time in its colonies and elsewhere, from which it drew an
annual income of 2,800 million marks. France's foreign capital at this
time amounted to 32,000 million marks, with an annual income of at least
1,300 million. Germany, finally, had invested 26,000 million, which
yielded 1,240 million annually. These great main streams, however,
ultimately break down into smaller tributaries. Just as the United
States is spreading capitalism further on the American continent, so
even Russia -- itself still fueled completely by French capital, and
English and German industry -- is already transferring loan capital and
industrial products to its Asian hinterland, to China, Persia and
Central Asia; it is involved in railway construction in China, etc.

We thus discover behind the dry hieroglyphs of international trade a
whole network of economic entanglements, which have nothing to do with
simple commodity exchange, which is all that the professorial wisdom can
notice.

We discover that the distinction Herr Bücher makes between countries of
industrial production and countries of raw-material production, the
flimsy scaffolding on which he hangs the whole of international
exchange, is itself only a crude product of professorial schematism.
Perfume, cotton goods and machines are all manufactured goods. But the
export of perfume from France only shows that France is the country of
luxury production for the thin stratum of the rich bourgeoisie across
the world; the export of cotton goods from Japan shows that Japan,
competing with Western Europe, is undermining the traditional peasant
and handicraft production throughout East Asia, driving it out by
commodity trade; while the export of machinery from England, Germany and
the United States shows that these three countries are themselves
propagating heavy industry to all regions of the world.

We thus discover that one "commodity" is exported and imported today
that was unknown in the time of King Nebuchadnezzar as well as in the
whole of the antique and medieval periods: _capital_. And this commodity
does not serve to fill "certain gaps" in other countries' "national
economies," but quite the reverse -- opening up gaps, rifts and splits
in the edifice of traditional "national economies," and acting like
gunpowder to transform these "national economies" sooner or later into
heaps of rubble. In this way, the "commodity" capital spreads still more
remarkable "commodities" on an ever more massive scale from various old
countries to the whole world: modern means of transport and the
destruction of whole indigenous populations, money economy and an
indebted peasantry, riches and poverty, proletariat and exploitation,
insecurity of existence and crises, anarchy and revolutions. The
European "national economies" extend their polyp-like tentacles to all
countries and people of the earth, strangling them in a great net of
capitalist exploitation.

### 1.4

Cannot Professor Bücher believe in a world economy, despite all this?
No. For the scholar explains, after he has carefully surveyed all
regions of the world and discovered nothing: I cannot help myself, I see
nothing in the way of "special phenomena" that "deviate in essential
characteristics" from a national economy, "and it is much to be doubted
whether such things will appear in the foreseeable future."

Let us now leave trade and trade statistics completely aside, and turn
directly to life, to the history of modern economic relations. Just a
single small passage from the great colorful picture.

In 1768, [Richard] Arkwright built the first mechanically driven cotton
spinning plant in Nottingham, and in 1785 [Edmund] Cartwright invented
the mechanical loom. The immediate result in England was the destruction
of handloom weaving and the rapid spread of mechanical manufacture. At
the start of the nineteenth century there were, according to one
estimate, around a million handloom weavers; they were now fated to die
out, and by 1860 no more than a few thousand remained in the whole
kingdom, out of more than half a million factory workers in the cotton
sector. In 1863, Prime Minister [William] Gladstone spoke in Parliament
of the "intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power" that the English
bourgeoisie had obtained, without the working class winning any share of
this.

The English cotton industry draws its raw material from North America.
The growth of factories in Lancashire conjured up immense cotton
plantations in the southern United States. Blacks were imported from
Africa for the deadly work on these plantations, as well as those of
sugar, rice and tobacco. The African slave trade expanded tremendously,
whole tribes were hunted down in the "dark continent," sold off by their
chiefs, transported across immense stretches over land and sea, to be
auctioned in America. A literal black "_Völkerwanderung_" took place. At
the end of the eighteenth century, in 1790, there were by one estimate
only 697,000 blacks; by 1861 there were over four million.

The colossal extension of the slave trade and slave labor in the South
of the United States triggered a crusade by the Northern states against
this un-Christian atrocity. The massive import of English capital in the
years 1825-60 made possible a vigorous railway construction in the
Northern states, the beginnings of their own industry and with it a
bourgeoisie enthusiastic for more modern forms of exploitation, for
capitalist wage-slavery. The fabulous business of the Southern planters,
who could drive their slaves to death within seven years, was all the
more intolerable to the pious Puritans of the North because their own
climate prevented them from establishing a similar paradise in their own
states. At the instigation of the Northern states, slavery in every form
was abolished for the whole of the Union in 1861. The Southern planters,
whose deepest feelings were injured, answered this blow with open
revolt. The Southern states declared their secession from the Union, and
the great Civil War broke out.

The immediate effect of the war was the devastation and economic ruin of
the Southern states. Production and trade collapsed, the supply of
cotton was interrupted. This deprived English industry of its raw
material, and in 1863 a tremendous crisis broke out in England, the
so-called "cotton famine." In Lancashire, 250,000 workers lost their
jobs completely, 166,000 were only employed part-time, and just 120,000
workers were still fully employed. The population of this district was
racked by poverty, and 50,000 workers asked Parliament in a petition to
vote funds to enable their families to emigrate. The Australian states,
which lacked the labor-power required to begin their capitalist
development -- after the indigenous population had been almost
completely exterminated by the European settlers -- declared that they
were prepared to accept unemployed proletarians from England. But the
English manufacturers protested vigorously against the emigration of
their "living machinery," which they would need again themselves as soon
as the anticipated revival of industry took place. The workers were
refused the funds for emigration, and had to bear the full weight of the
crisis and its terrors.

Denied American supply, English industry sought to obtain its raw
material elsewhere, and turned its attention to the East Indies. Cotton
plantations were feverishly started here, and rice cultivation, which
had provided the daily food of the population for millennia and formed
the basis of their existence, had to give way in large areas to the
profitable projects of speculators. In the wake of this suppression of
rice cultivation, the next few years saw an extraordinary price rise and
a famine that carried off over a million people in Orissa alone, a
district north of Bengal.

A second experiment took place in Egypt. To take advantage of the
opportunity provided by the American Civil War, the Egyptian khedive,
Ismail Pasha, began cotton plantations as rapidly as possible. A real
revolution took place in the country's property relations and rural
economy. Large area of peasant land were stolen, being declared royal
property and transformed into very large-scale plantations. Thousands of
workers were driven to forced labor on the plantations at the end of the
whip, to build dams and canals for the khedive, or to pull ploughs. But
borrowing the money needed to obtain the most modern steam-ploughs and
hulling machines led to the khedive sinking ever deeper in debt to
English and French bankers. This large-scale speculation ended with
bankruptcy after only a year, when the end of the American Civil War
brought the price of cotton down by three-quarters in the space of a few
days. The result of this cotton period for Egypt was the rapid ruin of
its peasant agriculture, the rapid collapse of its finances, and finally
the swift occupation of the country by the English army.

Meanwhile the cotton industry made new conquests. The Crimean War of
1855 [interrupted] the supply of hemp and flax from Russia, leading to a
major crisis of linen production in Western Europe. The collapse of the
old system in Russia, with the Crimean War, was followed right away by a
political transformation, the abolition of serfdom, liberal reforms,
free trade and the rapid building of railways. A new and stronger market
for industrial products was thus opened up within this great empire, and
the English cotton industry was the first to penetrate the Russian
market. At the same time, in the 1860s, a series of bloody wars opened
up China to English trade. England dominated the world market, and the
cotton industry made up half its exports. The period of the 1860s and
70s was the time of most brilliant business deals for the English
capitalists, as well as the time when they were most inclined to
guarantee their "hands" and secure "industrial peace" by small
concessions to the workers. It was in this period that the English trade
unions, with the cotton spinners and weavers in the lead, achieved their
most striking successes, as well as the time when the revolutionary
traditions of the Chartist movement and the Owenite ideas finally died
out among the English proletariat, ossifying into conservative trade
unionism.

But the page soon turned. Everywhere on the continent that England
exported its cotton products there gradually developed a local cotton
industry. Already in 1844, the hunger revolts of the handloom weavers in
Silesia and Bohemia had been the first heralds of the March revolution
[of 1848]. In the English colonies, too, an indigenous industry arose.
The cotton factories of Bombay soon competed with the English, and in
the 1880s helped to break England's monopoly on the world market.

In Russia, finally, the rise of cotton manufacture in the 1870s
inaugurated the age of large-scale industry and protective tariffs. In
order to circumvent the high tariff barrier, whole factories along with
their staff were taken from Saxony and the Vogtland to Russian Poland,
where the new manufacturing centers of Lodz and Zgierz grew into big
cities at a Californian pace. In the early 1880s, unrest in the
Moscow-Vladimir cotton district forced the first labor protection laws
in the tsarist empire. In 1896, 60,000 workers from the St Petersburg
cotton plants carried out the first mass strike in Russia. And nine
years later, in June 1905, 100,000 workers in Lodz, the third center of
the cotton industry, with German workers among their leaders, erected
the first barricades of the great Russian revolution ...

Here we have, in a few lines, 140 years in the history of a modern
branch of industry, a history that winds its way through all five
continents, hurls millions of human lives hither and thither, erupting
in one place as economic crisis, in another as famine, flaming up here
as war, there as revolution, leaving in its wake on all sides mountains
of gold and abysses of poverty -- a wide and blood-stained stream of
sweat from human labor.

These are convulsions of life, actions at a distance, that reach right
into the innards of nations, while the dry figures of international
trade statistics give only a pale reflection of them. In the century and
a half since modern industry was first established in England, the
capitalist world economy has taken shape at the price of the pains and
convulsions of the whole of humanity. It has seized one branch of
production after another, taken hold of one country after another. With
steam and electricity, fire and sword, it has obtained entry into the
most remote corners of the earth, has torn down all Chinese walls, and
through an era of world crises, periodic common catastrophes, it has
initiated the economic interconnection of present-day humanity. The
Italian proletarian, expelled from his misery at home by Italian
capital, who migrates to Argentina or Canada, finds there a ready-made
new yoke of capital imported from the United States or England. And the
German proletarian who remains at home and tries to make an honest
living, is dependent for his weal and woe at every turn on the course of
production and trade throughout the world. Whether he finds work or not,
whether his wage is sufficient to feed his wife and children, whether he
is condemned to spend several days of the week in enforced idleness, or
to work day and night in infernal overtime -- all this constantly varies
depending on the cotton harvest in the United States, the wheat harvest
in Russia, the discoveries of new gold or diamond mines in Africa, the
outbreak of revolution in Brazil, tariff battles, diplomatic turmoil and
war across five continents. Nothing is so striking today, nothing has
such decisive importance for the whole shape of today's social and
political life, as the yawning contradiction between an economic
foundation that grows tighter and firmer every day, binding all nations
and countries into a great whole, and the political superstructure of
states, which seeks to split nations artificially, by way of border
posts, tariff barriers and militarism, into so many foreign and hostile
divisions.

But none of this exists for Bücher, Sombart and their colleagues! For
them, all that exists is the "ever more complete microcosm"! They see
far and wide no "special phenomena" that would "depart in essential
characteristics" from a national economy. Is this not puzzling? Would a
similar blindness on the part of the official representatives of science
be conceivable for phenomena that leap to the eye of any observer in
their plenitude and their dazzling, lightning-like intensity, in any
area of science other than that of political economy? Certainly in
natural science, a professional scholar who tried to express the view
publicly that the earth did not revolve round the sun, but the sun and
all other stars revolved round the earth as their center, who maintained
that he "did not know any phenomena" that would contradict this view "in
essential characteristics" -- such a scholar could be sure of being met
by the Homeric laughter of the entire educated world, and would end up
having his mental health examined at the instigation of troubled
relatives. Of course, 400 years ago not only did the spread of such
views go unpunished, but anyone who undertook to refute them publicly
would himself run the risk of ending on the scaffold. In those days,
preservation of the mistaken view that the earth was the center of the
universe and the heavenly bodies was a pressing interest of the Catholic
church, and any attack on the imagined majesty of the earth in the
universe was at the same time an assault on the spiritual rule of the
church and its tithes on the earth. In those days, accordingly, natural
science was the ticklish nerve center of the prevailing social system,
and mystification in this realm was an indispensable instrument of
subjugation. Today, under the rule of capital, the ticklish point of the
social system is no longer faith in the mission of the earth in the blue
heaven, but rather faith in the mission of the bourgeois state on earth.
And because thick fog is already rising and gathering over the powerful
waves of the world economy, because storms are in preparation here that
will brush away the "microcosm" of the bourgeois state like a henhouse
in an earthquake, the scientific "Swiss guards" of the rule of capital
stand before the gate of their stronghold, the "national state," ready
to defend it to the last gasp. The first word of present-day political
economy, its basic concept, is a scientific mystification in the
interest of the bourgeoisie.

### 1.5

Political economy is frequently defined for us in the simple formula
that it is "the science of people's economic relations." Those who offer
this kind of formulation believe they have navigated the reefs of the
"national economy" and the world economy by universalizing the problem
into something indefinite and speaking of "people's" economic relations
in general. Tossing the problem up into thin air, however, does not make
it any more clear, but may well just confuse it even more, as the
question then arises as to why and wherefore this special science of
"people's" economic relations -- i.e. of _all_ people at all times and
in all circumstances -- should be necessary.

Let us take any example we like of people's economic relations, as
simple and transparent as possible. Let us place ourselves in the time
when the present world economy did not yet exist, when commodity trade
flourished only in the towns while in the countryside a natural economy
still prevailed, i.e. production for one's own need, with the large
landed proprietors as well as on the small peasant holdings. Let us
take, for example, the relations described by Dugald Stewart in the
Scottish highlands in the 1850s:

>In some parts of the Highlands of Scotland ... every peasant, according
>to the Statistical Account, made his own shoes of leather tanned by
>himself. Many a shepherd and cottar too, with his wife and children,
>appeared at Church in clothes which had been touched by no hands but
>their own, since they were shorn from the sheep and sown in the
>flax-field. In the preparation of these, it is added, scarcely a single
>article had been purchased, except the awl, needle, thimble, and a very
>few parts of the ironwork employed in the weaving. The dyes, too, were
>chiefly extracted by the women from trees, shrubs, and herbs.

Alternatively, we can take an example from Russia, where only a
relatively short time ago, in the late 1860s, the peasant economy could
be commonly described as follows:

>The land that he [the farmer of the Viasma district in the province of
>Smolensk -- R.L.] cultivates provides him with food and clothing,
>almost everything that is necessary for his existence: bread, potatoes,
>milk, meat, linen, cloth, sheep pelts and wool for warm clothing ...
>All that he buys with money are boots and a few personal items such as
>belt, cap and gloves, as well as some necessary household equipment:
>iron and wooden dishes, poker, kettle and the like.

Today there are still peasant economies of this kind in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, in Serbia and Dalmatia. If we were to put to one of these
self-sufficient peasants in the Scottish Highlands or Russia, Bosnia or
Serbia the usual professorial questions of political economy about
"economic purpose," "creation and distribution of wealth" and the like,
he would stare at us in amazement. As to the reason why he and his
family work, or to put it in scholarly terms, the "motivating force"
that drives their "economic activity." he would exclaim: Well, we have
to live, and food doesn't just drop from the sky. If we didn't work,
we'd die of starvation. So we work to get by, to eat our fill, to put
clothes on our back and have a roof over our head. As to _what_ we
produce, "what orientation" we give our labor, that's another foolish
question! We produce what we need, what any peasant family needs to
live. We grow wheat and rye, oats and barley, we plant potatoes, we keep
a few cows and sheep, chickens and ducks. In winter we do the spinning,
which is women's work, while men are busy with axes, saws and hammers
making whatever the house needs. You can call this a "rural economy" or
a "business," whatever you like, but at all events we have to do a bit
of everything, as all kinds of things are needed in the home and the
fields. How do we "divide" these tasks? Another strange question! The
men naturally do what needs male strength, the women take care of the
house, the cows and the henhouse, the children help with this and that.
Or are you saying that I should send my wife to chop wood while I milk
the cows myself? (The good man is unaware -- we can add here -- that
there are many primitive peoples, for example the Brazilian Amerindians,
where it is precisely the woman who gathers wood in the forest, digs up
roots and goes to pick fruit, while among the herding peoples of Africa
and Asia men not only look after the cattle but also milk them. In
Dalmatia today, you can still see a woman carrying a heavy load on her
back with a strong man complacently riding his donkey alongside, puffing
away at his pipe. This "division of labor" seems just as natural to them
as it appears obvious to our own peasants that the man should chop wood
and his wife milk the cows.) And besides, this question about my
"wealth"! That again, every child in the village understands. A wealthy
peasant is one who has a full barn, a well-stocked stable, a respectable
flock of sheep and a large henhouse; a peasant is poor if he runs short
of flour already by Easter, and water drips through his roof when it
rains. What does an "increase in wealth" depend on? No question about
it. If I had a larger plot of land, I would naturally be richer, and if
in summer, Heaven forbid, we had a heavy hailstorm, everyone in the
village would be impoverished in the space of twenty-four hours.

Here we have let the peasant patiently answer the learned questions of
political economy, but we are certain that, before the professor who
arrived with his notebook and fountain pen to make a scientific study of
such a peasant household in the Scottish Highlands or Bosnia had asked
even half of his questions, he would already have been shown out of the
door. In fact, all relationships in this kind of peasant economy are so
simple and self-evident that their dissection with the scalpel of
political economy seems an idle game.

The objection can of course be made that we perhaps chose an unfortunate
example, by focusing on a tiny self-sufficient peasant household whose
extreme simplicity is determined by its scanty resources and dimensions.
So let us take another example. Leaving the small peasant household to
continue its modest existence in a remote corner of the world, we turn
our attention to the highest summit of a powerful empire, the household
of Charlemagne. This sovereign, who made the Germanic Empire the most
powerful in Europe at the start of the ninth century, undertaking no
fewer than fifty-three crusades for the expansion and strengthening of
his realm, and uniting under his scepter not just present-day Germany
but also France, Italy, Switzerland, the northern part of Spain, Holland
and Belgium, was also very concerned with economic conditions on his
lands and estates. He drafted personally a special legislative decree on
the economic principles of his estates, consisting of seventy
paragraphs, the celebrated "_Capitulare de villis_," i.e. law about
landed estates, a priceless gem of historical survival which has happily
come down to us through the dust and mildew of the archives. This claims
very special attention for two reasons. Firstly, most of Charlemagne's
estates subsequently developed into powerful imperial cities: Aachen,
Cologne, Munich, Basel and Strasbourg, for example, along with several
other towns, were at this time agricultural estates of the emperor.
Secondly, Charlemagne's economic institutions became a model for all
major spiritual and temporal landed estates of the early Middle Ages;
these adopted the survivals of ancient Rome and the refined way of life
of its noble villas, transplanting them into the coarser milieu of the
young Germanic warrior nobility, and his prescriptions for the
cultivation of vineyards and gardens, fruit and vegetables, fowl, etc.
were an act in the history of civilization.

Let us take a closer look at this decree. The great emperor demanded
here, above all else, to be served honestly and have his properties
looked after so that his subjects living on them were protected against
poverty; they should not be overburdened with labor; if they worked at
night, they were to be compensated for this. But the subjects for their
part were to take diligent care of the vineyards and put the pressed
wine into bottles to avoid damage. If they evaded their duties they were
chastised "on the back or elsewhere." The emperor also lay down that
bees and geese were to be kept on his domains; the birds were to be kept
well and increased. The stocks of cows and brood mares were also to be
expanded, and the greatest care taken of sheep.

We desire, the emperor continued, that our woods are managed properly,
that they are not uprooted and that sparrowhawks and falcons are kept
there. Fat geese and chickens should be always available for us; eggs
that are not consumed in the household should be sold on the market.
Each of our estates should keep a store of good featherbeds, mattresses,
covers, tableware of copper, lead, iron and wood, chains, kettle-hooks,
axes and drills, so that nothing needs to be borrowed from other people.
The emperor further prescribed that an exact account be kept of the
harvests from his estates, and he lists: vegetables, butter, cheese,
honey, oil, vinegar, turnips "and other trifles," as it says in the text
of the famous decree. He continues that on each of his estates there
should be various artisans, a sufficient number fluent in every craft,
and he again lists the precise kinds in detail. He also made Christmas
Day the date on which he required accounts of his wealth, and the
smallest peasant did not count each head of stock and each egg on his
holding more carefully than the great Charlemagne. Paragraph 62 of the
decree states: "It is important that we know what and how much we have
of all these things." And he again lists: oxen, mills, wood, ships, wine
stocks, vegetables, wool, linen, flax, fruit, bees, fish, hides, wax and
honey, old and new wine, and whatever else was supplied to him. He adds,
as generous consolation for the dear subjects who were to supply all
this: "We hope that all this does not appear too hard to you, for you
can demand the same for your part, since everyone is lord of his
property." Further, we find exact prescriptions as to the way in which
wines should be packed and transported, these apparently being a
particular concern in the great emperor's governance: "Wine should be
carried in barrels with firm iron hoops and never in skins. As for
flour, this is to be carried in doubled crates and covered with leather,
so that it can be brought across rivers without damage being done. I
also want exact account to be made of the horns of my goats, male and
female, as well of the skins of the wolves that are shot each year. In
the month of May, merciless war against the young wolf cubs should not
be neglected." Finally, in the last paragraph, Charlemagne lists all the
flowers, trees and plants that he wants to have tended in his garden:
roses, lilies, rosemary, gherkins, onions, radishes, caraway, etc. The
famous decree more or less comes to an end with a list of varieties of
apple.

This is a picture of the imperial economy in the ninth century, and
although we have here one of the most powerful and richest princes of
the Middle Ages, anyone must admit that his economy, along with the
principles on which it was managed, are surprisingly reminiscent of the
dwarf-size peasant holding that we considered above. Here too, the
imperial landlord, if we were to put to him the familiar basic questions
of political economy about the nature of wealth, the purpose of
production, the division of labor, etc., etc., would refer with a royal
wave of the hand to the mountains of grain, wool and flax, the barrels
of wine, oil and vinegar, the stables full of cows, oxen and sheep. And
we would be equally at a loss to know what "laws" of political-economic
science were to be investigated and deciphered in this economy, since
all the connections, cause and effect, labor and its result, are as
clear as day.

The reader might draw our attention here, once again, to the fact that
we have taken a misleading example. It is clear after all from
Charlemagne's decree that this was not dealing with the public economic
relationships of the Germanic Empire, but rather with the private
economy on the emperor's estates. But it would certainly be a historical
error for anyone to try to oppose these two concepts in the context of
the Middle Ages. The capitulary does indeed refer to the economy on the
estates and properties of Charlemagne, but he managed this economy as
ruler, not as a private person. Or more accurately: the emperor was a
lord on his domains, but likewise any noble lord in the Middle Ages,
i.e. in the time _after_ Charlemagne, was more or less such an emperor
on a small scale, i.e. he was by virtue of his free noble domain a
legislator, tax collector and judge for the population on his estates.
The very form of Charlemagne's economic dispositions, as we have
mentioned them, shows that these were indeed acts of government: they
make up one of his sixty-five laws or capitularies which, drafted by the
emperor, were made known at the annual imperial assemblies of his
magnates. And the regulations about radishes and iron-clad wine barrels
derive from the same fullness of power and are drafted in the same style
as, for example, the admonitions to the bishops in his "_Capitula
episcoporum_," in which Charles gives the bishops a box on the ears and
warns them energetically not to curse, not to get drunk, not to visit
places of ill-fame, not to keep women or charge too high a price for the
holy sacraments. We may go where we please in the Middle Ages, but
nowhere in the countryside do we find an economic enterprise for which
Charlemagne's does not offer a model and a type, whether it is the
estates of noble lords or the simple peasant holding, whether we have an
individual peasant family operating for itself or a communally operating
mark community.

What is most striking in both examples is that here the needs of human
life directly govern and determine labor, and the result thus
corresponds so exactly to intention and need that the relationships
maintain, whether on a greater or smaller scale, this surprising
simplicity and transparency. Both the small peasant on his holding and
the great monarch in his court know quite exactly what they want to
achieve by their production. And no magic is required to know this: both
want to satisfy the natural human needs for eating and drinking,
clothing and the conveniences of life. The only difference is that the
peasant sleeps on a straw sack and the great lord on a soft featherbed,
one drinks beer and mead, or just plain water, while the other has fine
wine on his table. But the basis of the economy and its task of directly
satisfying human needs remains the same. The result corresponds in the
same self-evident way to the labor that proceeds from this natural task.
Here too, again, there are differences in the labor process: the peasant
works along with his family members, and the fruits of his labor
correspond to the extent of his holding and his share in the common
land; more precisely -- since we are speaking here of medieval serf
labor -- he what is left over after providing dues and labor services
for the lords and the church. The emperor or any other noble lord does
not work himself, but has his subjects and subordinates work for him.
But whether a peasant and his family work for themselves, or all
together under the management of a village headman, or under the lord's
bailiff, the result of this labor is still nothing other than a
particular sum of means of subsistence in the wider sense, i.e.
precisely what is required, and more or less in the amount required. No
matter which way you look at an economy of this kind, there is no puzzle
to be found in it that could only be solved by profound investigation
and a special science. The slowest-witted peasant in the Middle Ages
knew precisely what his "wealth" -- or rather, his poverty -- depended
on, leaving aside the natural phenomena that visited both lord's and
peasant's lands from time to time. He knew quite precisely that his
distress as a peasant had a very simple and direct cause: first of all
the boundless extraction of labor services and dues on the part of the
lords, and secondly the theft by these same lords of common lands --
woods, meadows and waters. And what the peasant knew he cried aloud to
the world in the peasant wars, and showed by setting fire to the houses
of his bloodsuckers. What remains for scientific investigation here is
only the historical origin and development of those relationships, the
question as to how it could happen that throughout Europe the formerly
free peasant landholdings were transformed into noble estates extracting
dues and tolls, the formerly free peasantry into a mass of subjects
liable to serf labor and later also to monetary dues.

The situation looks completely different as soon as we turn to any
phenomenon of _present-day_ economic life. Let us take for example one
of the most remarkable and outstanding phenomena: the _trade crisis_. We
have all experienced already several major crises of trade and industry,
and are familiar from our own observation with the process classically
described by Frederick Engels in the following terms:

>Commerce is at a standstill, the markets are glutted, products
>accumulate, as multitudinous as they are unsalable, hard cash
>disappears, credit vanishes, factories are closed, the mass of the
>workers are in want of the means of subsistence; bankruptcy follows
>upon bankruptcy, execution upon execution. The stagnation lasts for
>years; productive force and products are wasted and destroyed
>wholesale, until the accumulated mass of commodities finally filter
>off, more or less depreciated in value, until production and exchange
>gradually begin to move again. Little by little the pace quickens. It
>becomes a trot. The industrial trot breaks into a canter, the canter in
>return grows into the headlong gallop of a perfect steeplechase of
>industry, commercial credit, and speculation, which finally, after
>breakneck leaps, ends where it began -- in the ditch of a crisis.

We all know that a commercial crisis of this kind is the terror of every
modern country, and the way in which such a crisis is heralded is
already very instructive. After a spell of some years of prosperity and
good business, a vague rumor begins in the press here and there, with
reports of some disturbing news about bankruptcies on the stock
exchanges; then the spots in the press become larger, the stock exchange
ever more turbulent, the central bank raises the discount rate, making
the supply of credit more difficult and limited, until news about
bankruptcies and unsalable stocks falls like a cloudburst. The crisis is
then in full swing, and the struggle now is about who bears
responsibility. The business people blame the brusque refusal of credit
by the banks, the banks blame the speculative craze of the stockbrokers,
they in turn blame the industrialists, the industrialists blame the lack
of money in the country, and so on. And when business finally begins to
get under way again, it is once more the stock exchange and the
newspapers that note the first signs of improvement, until hope, calm
and security again appear for a while. What is remarkable about all
this, however, is the fact that the crisis is seen and treated by all
those involved, by the whole society, as something that stands outside
the realm of human will and human calculation, like a blow of fate
inflicted on us by an invisible power, a test from heaven of the same
order as a severe storm, an earthquake or a flood. Even the language in
which the newspapers like to report a crisis is fond of such expressions
as "gloomy clouds are gathering over the formerly bright skies of the
business world," or, if a sharp increase in the discount rate is
announced, they inevitably use the headline "Storm Signal," just as we
later read about the thunder passing and the horizon brightening. This
way of writing expresses rather more than mere fatuousness on the part
of the ink coolies of the business world, it is precisely typical of the
strange effect of the crisis, its apparently law-like character. Modern
society notes its approach with terror, it bends its neck and trembles
at the hail-like blows, it awaits the end of the test and then raises
its head again, at first timid and unbelieving, then finally relieved.

This is precisely the way that, in the Middle Ages, people awaited the
outbreak of a great famine or plague, the way that country folk today
suffer a heavy thunderstorm and hail: the same helplessness and
impotence in the face of a severe trial. And yet famine and plague, even
if ultimately social phenomena, are initially and immediately the
results of natural phenomena: a harvest failure, the spread of
disease-inducing germs and the like. Thunder is a basic event of
physical nature, and no one, at least at the present stage of science
and technology, is able to bring about a thunderstorm or to avert one.
But what is this modern crisis? It consists, as we know, in too many
commodities being produced without finding an outlet, with the result
that trade and industry come to a halt. The production and sale of
commodities, trade and industry -- all these are purely human relations.
It is people themselves who produce commodities, and people themselves
who buy them; trade is conducted between one person and another, and in
the circumstance that make up the modern crisis we do not find a single
element that lies outside of human action. It is therefore nothing other
than human society itself that periodically provokes the crisis. And yet
we also know that the crisis is a real trial for modern society, that it
is expected with dread and suffered with desperation, that it is not
wanted or wished for by anyone. Apart from a few stock-exchange sharks
who try to enrich themselves quickly during a crisis at the expense of
others, but frequently fail in the process, the crisis is for everyone
at the very least a danger or a disturbance. No one wants the crisis,
and yet it comes. People create it with their own hands, yet they do not
intend it for anything in the world. The medieval peasant on his little
plot produced partly what his lord required, partly what he himself
needed: grain and meat, provisions for himself and his family. The great
medieval lord had others produce for him what he wanted and needed:
grain and meat, fine wines and fine clothes, means of subsistence and
luxury goods for himself and his household. Present-day society however
produces what it neither wants nor can use: crises. It periodically
produces means of subsistence that it cannot consume; it suffers
periodic hunger alongside tremendous stocks of unsold products. Need and
satisfaction, the purpose and the result of labor, no longer match;
between them stands something unclear and puzzling.

Let us take another example, all too well known to workers of all
countries: _unemployment_. Unemployment is no longer, like crises, a
cataclysm that visits society from time to time. It has become today, to
a greater or lesser degree, a constant and everyday accompaniment to
economic life. The most well-organized and well-paid categories of
workers, who keep lists of their unemployed, show an uninterrupted
series of figures for each year, even each month and week; these figures
fluctuate substantially, but they never completely peter out. How
powerless present-day society is in the face of unemployment, this
dreadful scourge of the working class, is shown each time that the scale
of this evil becomes so great that it forces legislative bodies to
concern themselves with it. The regular course of such discussions,
after a lengthy to-ing and fro-ing, culminates in the decision to
conduct an inquiry, an investigation, into the present number of
unemployed. The main thing here is to measure the present state of the
evil, as the level of water is measured with a depth gauge in times of
flood, and in the best case weak palliative measures are taken in the
form of support for the unemployed -- generally at the cost of those in
work -- with a view to dampening the effects of the evil, without the
slightest attempt being made to do away with the evil itself.

In the early years of the nineteenth century, Reverend [Thomas] Malthus,
the great prophet of the English bourgeoisie, proclaimed with the
heart-chilling brutality that was characteristic of him:

>A man born into a world already occupied, whose family has no means of
>supporting him or of whose labor society has no need, has not any right
>to demand any portion whatever of food. He is really one too many on
>the land. No cover is laid for him at the great banquet of Nature.
>Nature tells him to go away, and does not delay herself to put the
>order into execution.

Official society today, with its characteristic "social-reforming"
hypocrisy, scorns such crass expressions. In practice, however, it
finally tells the unemployed proletarian, "whose labor it does not
need," to "go away" in one way or another, quickly or slowly, to leave
this world -- the increasing figures of disease, infant mortality and
crimes against property during every great crisis speak for themselves.

The comparison we have made between unemployment and flood even shows
the striking fact that we are less _impotent_ in the face of elemental
events of a physical kind than we are towards our own, purely social,
purely human affairs! The periodic spring floods that do such damage in
the east of Germany are ultimately only the result of the current
neglected state of water management. The present level of technology
already affords sufficient means for protecting agriculture from the
power of water, even for making good use of this power; it is just that
these methods can only be applied at the highest level of a large-scale,
interconnected, rational water management, which would have to refigure
the whole area affected, appropriately disposing arable zones and
meadows, building dams and sluices, and regulating rivers. A great
reform of this kind can certainly not be undertaken, partly because
neither private capitalists nor the state are willing to provide the
resources for such an project, partly because on the large scale that
would be needed, the barriers of a whole range of private landowning
rights would be infringed. But society today does have the resources for
tackling the water danger and harnessing the raging element, even if it
is not in a position to use them at this time. On the other hand, this
society has not discovered a method for combating unemployment. And yet
this not an element, a natural phenomenon of physics, but a purely human
product of economic relations. And once again here we come up against an
economic puzzle, a phenomenon that no one intended, no one consciously
strove for, but which all the same appears with the regularity of a
natural phenomenon, over people's heads as it were.

But we need in no way take the case of these striking phenomena of
present-day life, crises or unemployment, calamities and cases of an
extraordinary nature, which in popular imagination form an exception to
the usual course of things. Let us take one of the most familiar
examples from everyday life, repeated a thousand times in all countries:
_the fluctuating prices of commodities_. Every child knows that the
prices of goods are in no case fixed and unchangeable, but on the
contrary, go up and down almost daily -- sometimes, indeed, every hour.
If we pick up a newspaper, and turn to the report on the commodities
market, we can read the price movements of the previous day: wheat
rather weak in the morning, somewhat livelier in the afternoon, rising
towards the close of business, or else falling. The same goes for copper
and iron, sugar and vegetable oil. And likewise with shares in different
industrial firms, government and private bonds, on the stock market.
Price fluctuations are a constant, daily, quite "normal" phenomenon of
contemporary economic life. These price movements, moreover, cause a
daily and hourly change in the wealth of those who possess all these
products and papers. If the cotton price rises, then the wealth of all
dealers and manufacturers who have stocks of cotton in their warehouses
also rises temporarily; if prices fall, their wealth dwindles similarly.
If copper prices rise, then the owners of shares in the copper mines
grow richer, and if these fall, they grow poorer. In this way, people
can become millionaires or beggars in a few hours as a result of simple
fluctuations in price, as reported in a stock-market telegram, and this
is the essential basis of the whole giddiness of stock-market
speculation. The medieval lord could grow richer or poorer as a result
of a good or a bad harvest, or enrich himself as a robber baron making a
good catch by waylaying a passing merchant, or -- and this was the most
well-tested and favored method -- increase his wealth by pressing more
out of his peasant serfs than he managed previously, by increasing the
services and dues he demanded. Today, a man can suddenly become rich or
poor without doing the slightest thing himself, without lifting a
finger, without any kind of natural event, even without anyone having
given him something or violently robbing him. Price fluctuations are
likewise a secretive movement, guided behind people's backs by an
invisible power, and causing a continuous shift and fluctuation in the
distribution of social wealth. The movement is noted in the same way as
temperature is indicated on a thermometer, air pressure on a barometer.
And yet commodity prices and their movements are obviously a purely
human affair, with no magic involved. It is no one but people themselves
who produce commodities with their own hands and determine their prices,
simply that here again their action gives rise to something that no one
intended or had in mind; here again, the need, end and result of
people's economic action come into blatant imbalance.

What is the reason for this, and what are the obscure laws that make
people's own economic life today bring about such strange events behind
their backs? This can only be revealed by scientific investigation. It
has become necessary to solve all these puzzles by way of strenuous
investigation, deep reflection, analysis and comparison, in other words
to make explicit the hidden connections that bring it about that the
results of people's economic action no longer coincide with their
intentions and their will -- in sum, their consciousness. The lack of
consciousness within the social economy thus becomes a task for
scientific research; and here we have arrived directly at the root of
political economy.

In recounting his journey around the world, Darwin says of the
inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego:

>They often suffer from famine: I heard Mr. Low, a sealing-master
>intimately acquainted with the natives of this country, give a curious
>account of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the
>west coast, who were very thin and in great distress. A succession of
>gales prevented the women from getting shellfish on the rocks, and they
>could not go out in their canoes to catch seal. A small party of these
>men one morning set out, and the other Indians explained to him, that
>they were going a four days' journey for food: on their return, Low
>went to meet them, and he found them excessively tired, each man
>carrying a great square piece of putrid whale's-blubber with a hole in
>the middle, through which they put their heads, like the Gauchos do
>through their ponchos or cloaks. As soon as the blubber was brought
>into a wigwam, an old man cut off thin slices, and muttering over them,
>broiled them for a minute, and distributed them to the famished party,
>who during this time preserved a profound silence.

So much for the life of one of the most backward peoples on earth. The
limits within which their will and deliberate ordering of their economy
can operate are here still extremely narrow. People here are still
completely tied to the apron strings of external nature, and depend on
its favor and disfavor. But within these narrow limits, the organization
of the whole small society of some hundred and fifty individuals
prevails. Concern for the future is only expressed in the wretched form
of a stock of putrid whale's blubber. But this putrid stock is divided
between everyone with due ceremony, and everyone similarly participates
in the work of seeking food, under planned leadership.

Let us turn to a Greek _oikos_, the household economy of antiquity with
slaves, which by and large also formed a "microcosm," a little world
unto itself. Here extreme social inequality already prevails. Primitive
need has been transformed into a comfortable surplus of the fruits of
human labor. Physical labor has become the curse of some, idleness the
privilege of others, with those who work even becoming the property of
the non-workers. Yet here again, this relationship of domination
involves the strictest planning and organization of the economy, the
labor process and distribution. The determining will of the master is
its foundation, the whip of the slave overseer its sanction.

On the feudal manor of the Middle Ages, the despotic organization of
labor receives early on the visage of a detailed code elaborated in
advance, in which the plan and division of labor, the duties of each as
well as their claims, are clearly and firmly defined. On the threshold
of this period of history stands that fine document that we have already
cited: Charlemagne's "_Capitulare de villis_," which still revels
joyously and brightly in the wealth of physical enjoyments to which the
economy is completely directed. At its end we have the baneful code of
services and dues which, dictated by the unrestrained financial greed of
the feudal lords, led to the German peasant war of the sixteenth
century, and made the French peasant still 200 years later into that
miserable and semi-bestialized creature who was only shaken to struggle
for his human and civil rights by the shrill alarm clock of the great
Revolution. But, until the broom of revolution swept away the feudal
manor, this peasant was still in the misery of the relationship of
direct mastery that firmly and clearly defined the relations of the
feudal economy as an unavoidable fate.

Today we have neither masters nor slaves, neither feudal barons nor
serfs. Freedom and equality before the law have in formal terms done
away with all despotic relationships, at least in the old bourgeois
states; in the colonies, as is well known, these same states have
frequently themselves introduced slavery and serfdom. Everywhere that
the bourgeoisie is at home, _free competition_ rules economic relations
as their one and only law. This means the disappearance from the economy
of any kind of plan or organization. Of course, if we look at an
individual private firm, a modern factory or a large complex of
factories and plants such as Krupp's, alternatively a great agricultural
enterprise such as those of North America, we find here the strictest
organization, the most far-reaching division of labor, the most refined
planning based on scientific knowledge. Here everything works
beautifully, directed by a _single_ will and consciousness. But we
scarcely leave the factory or farm gate than we are met already with
chaos. Whereas the countless individual components -- and a private firm
today, even the most gigantic, is only a fragment of the great economic
network that extends across the whole earth -- whereas the fragments are
most strictly organized, the whole of the so-called "national economy,"
i.e. the capitalist world economy, is completely unorganized. In the
whole, which stretches across oceans and continents, no plan, no
consciousness, no regulation prevails; only the blind reign of unknown,
uncontrolled forces plays its capricious game with people's economic
fate. There is indeed, still today, an over-powerful lord that governs
working humanity: _capital_. But its form of government is not despotism
but _anarchy_.

And it creates this anarchy by having the social economy bring about
results that are unexpected and puzzling even to the people involved; it
turns the social economy into a phenomenon that is foreign to us and
alienated, whose laws we have to discover in the same way as we
investigate the phenomena of external nature, which govern the life of
the vegetable and animal realms, changes in the earth's crust and the
movements of heavenly bodies. Scientific knowledge must subsequently
discover the meaning and rule of the social economy, which no conscious
plan has dictated in advance.

It is now clear why bourgeois political economists find it impossible to
clearly pinpoint the nature of their science, to put their finger into
the wound of their social order, to denounce it in its inherent
criminality. To discover and confess that anarchy is the life element of
the rule of capital means in the same breath to pronounce a death
sentence, it means saying that its existence is only granted a temporary
reprieve. It is clear now why the official scientific advocates of the
rule of capital seek to conceal the matter with every kind of
word-spinning, to direct attention away from the core to the outer
shell, from the global economy to the "national economy." At the very
first step across the threshold of political-economic knowledge, with
the first fundamental question as to what political economy actually is
and what is its basic problem, the paths of bourgeois and proletarian
knowledge already diverge. With this first question, however abstract
and immaterial for present social struggles it may appear at first
sight, a special tie is already drawn between political economy as a
science and the modern proletariat as a revolutionary class.

### 1.6

Once we adopt the perspective we have now reached, many things that
first appeared uncertain now become clear.

To start with, the question of how old political economy is. A science
whose task is to disclose the laws of the anarchic capitalist mode of
production could naturally not arise earlier than this mode of
production itself, not before the historical conditions for the class
rule of the modern bourgeoisie had gradually been assembled by political
and economic changes over the centuries.

According to Professor Bücher, of course, the origin of the present-day
social order was something extremely simple, having little to do with
preceding economic development. It was in fact the result of the
superior will and elevated wisdom of absolutist princes.

"The construction of the _national economy_," Bücher explains -- and we
already know that for a bourgeois professor the concept "national
economy" is only a mystifying description of capitalist production --

>is essentially a result of the political centralization that began with
>the rise of the territorial state model towards the end of the Middle
>Ages, and is reaching its culmination today with the creation of the
>unitary national state. The concentration of economic powers goes hand
>in hand with the bending of political special interests to the higher
>purposes of the whole. In Germany, it was the larger territorial
>princes who sought to bring the modern state idea to expression, in
>struggle with the landed aristocracy and the cities.

But princely power also wrought the same great deeds in the rest of
Europe -- in Spain, Portugal, England, France, and the Netherlands.

>In all these countries, if to a varying degree, the struggle with the
>separate powers of the Middle Ages took place: the great nobles, the
>cities, provinces, spiritual and temporal corporations. Initially, it
>was a question of abolishing the independent circles that stood as an
>obstacle in the way of political concentration. But at the underlying
>foundation of the movement that led to the development of princely
>absolutism, there still slumbered the world-historical idea that the
>new and greater tasks of human civilization required a united
>organization of whole peoples, a great living community of interest,
>and this could only arise on the basis of a common economy.

We have here the finest flowering of that serviceability in matters of
thought that we have already noted among German professors of political
economy. According to Professor Schmoller, the science of political
economy arose at the command of enlightened absolutism. According to
Professor Bücher, the whole capitalist mode of production is simply the
fruit of sovereign will and the heaven-storming plans of absolutist
princes. It would of course be very unfair to the great Spanish and
French despots, not to mention their petty German counterparts, to raise
the suspicion that in their boisterous games with the arrogant feudal
lords at the end of the Middle Ages, or their bloody crusades against
the cities of the Netherlands, they troubled themselves with any kind of
"world-historical ideas" or "tasks of human civilization." This would
mean turning historical events upside down.

Certainly, the establishment of large centralized bureaucratic states
was an indispensable precondition for the capitalist mode of production,
yet it was just as much itself only a _consequence_ of the new economic
requirements, so that it would be far more justifiable to turn Bücher's
proposition around and declare that the construction of political
centralization was "essentially" a fruit of the maturing "national
economy," i.e. of capitalist production.

But if absolutism had an incontestable share in this process of
historical preparation, it played this part with the same stupid lack of
thought of a blind instrument of historical developmental tendencies,
and could likewise contradict these same tendencies whenever the
occasion arose. Thus the medieval despots by the grace of God considered
the cities allied with them against the feudal lords simply as objects
for blackmail, which they betrayed again to the feudal lords at the
first opportunity. Thus they viewed the newly discovered regions of the
world, with all their population and culture, immediately and
exclusively as a suitable field for the most brutal, pernicious and
crude plunder, to fill the "princely treasuries" with gold nuggets as
quickly as possible, for a "higher cultural purpose." In the same way,
later, we had the stubborn resistance to interposing between the "grace
of God" rulers and their "loyal peoples" that sheet of paper, called a
bourgeois parliamentary constitution, which is just as indispensable for
the unhindered development of the rule of capital as is political unity
and the large centralized states themselves.

It was in fact quite other powers at work, great shifts in the economic
life of the European nations as they emerged from the Middle Ages, that
pioneered the move to the new form of economy.

Once the discovery of America and the circumnavigation of Africa, i.e.
the discovery of the sea route to India, had led to an unforeseen
upswing and a shift in trade, the dissolution of feudalism and the guild
regime was a powerful tendency in the towns. The violent conquests, land
acquisitions and plundering expeditions in the newly discovered lands,
the great spice trade with India, the extension of the slave trade
supplying black Africans to the American plantations, very soon created
in Western Europe new wealth and new needs. The small workshop of the
guild artisan with all its fetters proved an impediment on the necessary
expansion of production and its rapid progress. The great merchants
created a way out by gathering artisans together in large factories
outside the city precincts, so as to have them produce more speedily and
better, untroubled by the narrow-minded guild regulations.

In England, the new mode of production was introduced by a revolution in
the agricultural economy. The blossoming of wool manufacture in
Flanders, with its great demand for wool, gave English feudal nobles the
impulse to transform large expanses of agricultural land into
sheep-walks, which meant the larger part of the English peasantry being
driven out of house and home. This meant the creation of a massive
number of property-less workers, proletarians, at the disposal of the
emerging capitalist manufacture. The Reformation worked in the same
direction, with the confiscation of church properties, some of which
were handed to the court nobility and speculators, others squandered,
with the greater part of their peasant population likewise driven from
the soil. The manufacturers and capitalist farmers thus found a massive
poor and proletarianized population, outside both feudal and guild
restrictions, who, after a long martyrdom of vagabond existence, and
bloody persecution by law and police, found a safe haven in wage slavery
for the new class of exploiters. There immediately followed also the
great technological transformations in manufacturing, which made it
possible increasingly to use greater numbers of unskilled wage
proletarians in place of skilled artisans or alongside them.

All this pressure and striving towards new relationships came up against
feudal barriers and the misery of decomposing conditions. The natural
economy that was determined by feudalism and in its very nature, as well
as the impoverishment of the popular masses by the limitless pressure of
serfdom, naturally restricted the domestic market for manufactured
goods, while at the same time the guilds continued to fetter the most
important condition of production, labor-power, in the towns. The state
apparatus with its endless political fragmentation, its lack of public
security, its jumble of tariff and trade-policy confusion, inhibited and
burdened the new trade and production at every turn.

It was clear that the rising bourgeoisie in Western Europe, as
representative of free world trade and manufacture, had in some way or
another to clear all these obstacles out of the way, if it did not want
to completely renounce its world-historical mission. Before it broke
feudalism to pieces in the great French Revolution, it first struggled
with it critically, and the new science of political economy thus arose
as one of the most important ideological weapons of the bourgeoisie in
its struggle against the medieval feudal state and for the modern state
of the capitalist class. The new economic order that was breaking
through appeared right away in the form of new and rapidly arising
riches, which poured over West European society and stemmed from quite
different, more profitable and apparently inexhaustible sources than the
patriarchal methods of feudal peasant slavery, which in any case had
already reached the end of their natural life. The most striking source
of the new enrichment was at first not the emerging new mode of
production, but rather its pacemaker, the powerful upswing of world
trade on the emergence from the Middle Ages -- in the rich Italian
commercial republics on the Mediterranean and in Spain, where the first
questions of political economy arose, as well as the first attempts to
answer them.

What is wealth? How do states become wealthy, and how are they made
poor? This was the new problem, once the old notions of feudal society
had lost their traditional validity in the whirlpool of new relations.
Wealth is gold, for which anything can be bought. Trade therefore
creates wealth. So those states become rich that are in a position to
bring much gold into the country and not let any out. World trade,
therefore, along with colonial conquests in the newly discovered lands
and manufactures that produce goods for export, must be promoted by the
state, while the import of products from abroad, which would draw gold
out of the country, is forbidden. This was the first doctrine of
political economy, which appeared in Italy already at the end of the
sixteenth century, and came to prevail generally in the seventeenth
century in England and France. And no matter how crude this doctrine
was, it did offer the first sharp break with the mental universe of
feudal natural economy, the first bold criticism of it, the first
idealization of trade, of commodity production, and in this form -- of
capital: in sum the first program of a state policy after the hearts of
the young bourgeoisie struggling to advance.

The focus soon switched from the merchant to the commodity-producing
capitalist, but still only cautiously, under the mask of humble servant
in the anteroom of the feudal lord. Wealth is by no means gold, which is
simply the mediator in commodity trade, so the French _lumières_
proclaimed in the eighteenth century. What a childish confusion to see
gleaming metal as the firm basis of fortune! Can I eat metal if I'm
hungry, or can it protect me from the winter cold? Didn't the Persian
king Darius, with all his gold treasure, suffer from dreadful pangs of
thirst on the battlefield, and would have willingly given it all away
for a sip of water? No, wealth means the gifts of nature in foodstuffs
and materials, with which all of us, king and beggar alike, satisfy our
needs. The more lavishly a population satisfies its needs, the wealthier
a state is, as it can draw all the more in tax. But who is it that
coaxes nature to make corn into bread, to make the thread from which we
spin our clothes, the wood and ore from which we build houses and
machinery? Agriculture! It is agriculture, not trade, that forms the
true fount of wealth. The mass of the agricultural population,
accordingly, the peasant masses whose hands create the wealth of
everyone, must be rescued from their boundless misery, protected from
feudal exploitation, raised up to well-being! (And in this way I shall
also find a market for my goods, the manufacturing capitalist quietly
adds.) The great lords of the land, therefore, the feudal barons, into
whose hands the whole wealth of agriculture flows, should be the only
ones who pay taxes and maintain the state! (Which means, the capitalist
again murmurs into his beard with a smile, that I also need pay no
taxes.) Agriculture, accordingly, work in the bosom of nature, need only
be freed from all the chains of feudalism, for the springs of wealth to
flow in their natural abundance for people and state, and the supreme
happiness of all people to stand automatically in a necessary harmony
with the whole.

If in these Enlightenment doctrines could be clearly heard already the
approaching rumble of the storming of the Bastille [in 1789], the
capitalist bourgeoisie soon felt strong enough to throw off the mask of
obsequiousness, place itself sturdily in the foreground and demand
without beating about the bush the restructuring of the whole state to
suit them. Agriculture was in no way the only source of wealth, Adam
Smith declared in England in the late eighteenth century. All wage labor
that was harnessed to commodity production created wealth, whether on
the farm or in manufacture! (Any kind of _labor_, said Adam Smith; but
for him and his followers -- who were already no more than a mouthpiece
for the emerging bourgeoisie -- people who labored were by nature
capitalist wage-laborers!) For all wage-labor created, besides the most
necessary wage for the worker's own subsistence, also rent to maintain
the lord of the land and a profit as the wealth of the owner of capital,
the entrepreneur. And this wealth was all the greater, the larger the
number of workers in a workshop who were harnessed to labor under the
command of a single capital, and the more detailed and meticulous the
division of labor among them. This then was the true natural harmony,
the true wealth of nations: from any kind of work, a wage for the
laborers, a wage that kept them alive and forced them to further
wage-labor; a rent sufficient for the careless life of the lords; and a
profit attractive enough to make it worthwhile for the entrepreneur to
pursue his business. _Everyone_ is provided for without the clumsy old
methods of feudalism. Promoting the "wealth of nations," therefore,
meant promoting the wealth of the capitalist entrepreneur, who keeps the
whole system in motion and with it the golden vein of wealth -- the
bleeding of wage-labor. Away then with all chains and obstacles of the
good old days, as well as the more recent paternal methods of the state.
Free competition, the free blossoming of private capital, the whole
apparatus of taxation and state in the service of the capitalist
entrepreneur -- and everything will be for the best in this best of all
worlds!

This was the economic gospel of the bourgeoisie, with all the wrappings
peeled away, and with it political economy finally acquired its
fundamental and true form. Of course, the practical reform proposals and
advice of the bourgeoisie to the feudal state came to grief as
hopelessly as all historic attempts to pour new wine into old bottles.
In twenty-four hours the hammer of revolution succeeded in doing what
half a century of reforming patchwork had failed to do. It was in fact
the conquest of political power that provided the bourgeoisie with the
conditions of their supremacy. But political economy, along with the
philosophical, social and natural-rights theories of the age of
Enlightenment, was above all a means for acquiring self-consciousness, a
formulation of the class consciousness of the bourgeoisie and as such a
precondition and impulse for the revolutionary act. Even in its palest
offshoots, the work of bourgeois world-renovation in Europe was fed by
the ideas of classical political economy. The bourgeoisie in England, in
its stormy period of struggle for free trade, with which it inaugurated
its supremacy on the world market, drew its weapons from the arsenal of
Smith and Ricardo. And even the reformers of the
Stein-Hardenberg-Scharnhorst era, who wanted to give Prussia's feudal
plunder a more modern touch after the blows received at the battle of
Jena, if only to enhance its capacity for survival, developed their
ideas from the doctrines of the English classics, so that the "young
German" political economist [Alexander von der] Marwitz could write in
1810 that along with Napoleon, Adam Smith was the most powerful ruler in
Europe.

If we understand then why political economy first arose some hundred and
fifty years ago, its later destiny becomes clear from the same point of
view. If political economy appears as a science of the particular laws
of the capitalist mode of production, its existence and function are
evidently linked to the existence of this, and lose their foundation
once this mode of production ceases to exist. In other words: political
economy as a science has played out its role as soon as the anarchic
economy of capitalism makes way for a planned economic order,
consciously organized and managed by the whole of working society. The
victory of the modern working class and the realization of socialism
accordingly mean the end of political economy as a science. This is
where a particular connection arises between political economy and the
class struggle of the modern proletariat.

If it is the task and object of political economy to explain the laws of
the origin, development and spread of the capitalist mode of production,
it is an unavoidable consequence that it must as a further consequence
also discover the laws of the decline of capitalism, which just like
previous economic forms is not of eternal duration, but is simply a
transitional phase of history, a rung on the endless ladder of social
development. The doctrine of the emergence of capitalism thus logically
turns into the doctrine of the decline of capitalism, the science of the
mode of production of capital into the scientific foundation of
socialism, the theoretical means of the bourgeoisie's domination into a
weapon of the revolutionary class struggle for the liberation of the
proletariat.

This second part of the general problem of political economy has of
course not been solved by either French or English scholars from the
bourgeois class, still less their German counterparts. One man drew the
final consequences of the theory of the capitalist mode of production, a
man who stood from the start on the class position of the revolutionary
proletariat: Karl Marx. With this, socialism and the modern workers'
movement was placed for the first time on an unshakeable foundation of
scientific knowledge.

Socialism goes back for thousands of years, as the ideal of a social
order based on equality and the brotherhood of man, the ideal of a
communistic society. With the first apostles of Christianity, various
religious sects of the Middle Ages, and in the German peasants' war, the
socialist idea always glistened as the most radical expression of rage
against the existing society. But in this ideal form, which could
commend itself to any social milieu at any time, socialism remained no
more than a golden fantasy, as unachievable as the appearance of the
rainbow against the background of clouds.

It was in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century that the
socialist idea first appeared with vigor and force, freed from religious
enthusiasm, but rather as an opposition to the terror and devastation
that emerging capitalism wreaked on society. Yet this socialism too was
basically nothing but a dream, the invention of individual bold minds.
If we listen to the first forerunner of the revolutionary uprisings of
the proletariat, Gracchus Babeuf, who carried out an attempted coup
during the great French Revolution for the forcible introduction of
social equality, the only fact on which he was able to base his
communist strivings was the gaping inequality of the existing social
order. He did not tire, in his passionate articles and pamphlets,
likewise in his speech in his own defense before the tribunal that
sentenced him to death, of painting this in the most dismal colors. His
gospel of socialism was a monotonous repetition of charges against the
inequality of the existing order, against the sufferings and pains, the
misery and humiliation, of the working masses, at whose expense a
handful of idle people grow rich and rule. It was enough for Babeuf that
the existing social order deserved to collapse, and it could in fact
have been overthrown a hundred years earlier if there had been a group
of determined men to seize state power and introduce a regime of
equality, as the Jacobins of 1795 sought to seize political power and
introduce the republic.

The socialist ideas represented by the three great thinkers: [Claude
Henri] Saint-Simon and [Charles] Fourier in France, [Robert] Owen in
England, in the 1820s and 30s, with far greater genius and brilliance,
relied on quite different methods, but essentially rested on the same
foundation. Certainly, none of these three had in mind a revolutionary
seizure of power for the realization of socialism; on the contrary, they
were, like the whole generation that followed the great Revolution [of
1789], disappointed by all social overthrow and all politics, and avowed
supporters of purely peaceful propaganda methods. Yet the basis of the
socialist idea was the same for all three: in essence, this was simply
the project and invention of a mind of genius, who recommended its
realization to tortured humanity, in order to redeem them from the hell
of the bourgeois social order.

These socialist theories thus remained, despite the force of their
criticisms and the spell of their future ideals, without significant
influence on the real movements and struggles of contemporary history.
Babeuf and his handful of friends sank like a frail bark in the powerful
counter-revolutionary wash, without at first leaving any trace but a
short illuminating line on the pages of revolutionary history.
Saint-Simon and Fourier only founded sects of enthusiastic and talented
supporters, who after a while scattered or took new directions, after
they had spread rich and fertile stimulus in terms of social ideas,
criticisms and initiatives. It was Owen who had most effect on the mass
of the proletariat, yet even his influence, after inspiring an elite
troop of English workers in the 1830s and 40s, subsequently disappeared
without trace.

A new generation of socialist leaders emerged in the 1840s: [Wilhelm]
Weitling in Germany, [Pierre Joseph] Proudhon, Louis Blanc and Blanqui
in France. The working class, for its part, had already embarked on
struggle against the rule of capital, it had given the signal for class
struggle in the elemental insurrections of the Lyons silk weavers in
France, and in the Chartist movement in England. But there was no direct
connection between these spontaneous stirrings of exploited masses and
the various socialist theories. The revolutionary proletarian masses did
not have a definite socialist goal in mind, nor did the socialist
theorists seek to base their ideas on a political struggle of the
working class. Their socialism was to be realized by cleverly
thought-out arrangements, such as Proudhon's "people's bank" for fair
exchange of goods, or Louis Blanc's producer associations. The only
socialist who counted on political struggle as a means to carry out the
social revolution was Blanqui, who was in this way the only genuine
representative of the proletariat and its revolutionary class interest
in this period. But his socialism was basically a project that was
achievable at any time, as the fruit of the determined will of a
revolutionary minority and a sudden overthrow that this would achieve.

The year 1848 was to see both the culmination and the crisis of this
earlier socialism in all its varieties. The Paris proletariat,
influenced by traditions of earlier revolutionary struggle and roused by
various socialist systems, passionately clung to the vague ideas of a
just social order. As soon as the bourgeois monarchy of Louis-Philippe
was toppled, the Paris workers used their position of power to demand
from the terrified bourgeoisie the realization now of the "social
republic" and a new "organization of labor." For the achievement of this
program, the proletariat afforded the provisional government the
celebrated timeframe of three months, during which time the workers
starved and waited, while the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie quietly
armed and prepared the subjection of the workers. The period ended with
the memorable butchery of June, in which the ideal of a "social
republic" achievable at any time was drowned in the streaming blood of
the Paris proletariat. The revolution of 1848 did not introduce the
realm of social equality, but rather the political rule of the
bourgeoisie and an unprecedented upswing of capitalist exploitation
under the Second Empire.

At the same time, however, that socialism of the old schools seemed
buried forever beneath the demolished barricades of the June
insurrection, the socialist idea was placed on a completely new footing
by Marx and Engels. These two sought the basis for socialism not in
moral repugnance towards the existing social order nor in cooking up all
kinds of possible attractive and seductive projects, designed to smuggle
in social equality within the present state. They turned to the
investigation of the _economic_ relationships of present-day society.
Here, in the laws of capitalist anarchy itself, Marx discovered the real
starting-point for socialist efforts. If the French and English classics
of political economy had discovered the laws by which the capitalist
economy lived and developed, Marx took up their work half a century
later precisely at the point where they had broken this off. He
discovered for his part how these same laws of the present-day social
order acted towards their own downfall, by increasingly threatening the
existence of society with the spread of anarchy and forming a chain of
devastating economic and political catastrophes. It was thus, as Marx
showed, the developmental tendencies of the rule of capital itself that
at a certain stage of their maturity made necessary the transition to a
planned mode of production, consciously organized by the whole working
society, if the whole of society and human culture were not to collapse
in the convulsions of unleashed anarchy. And the rule of capital
hastened this fateful hour ever more energetically by bringing together
its future gravediggers, the proletarians, in ever greater masses, by
spreading itself over all corners of the earth, producing an anarchic
world economy and in this way creating the basis for the proletariat of
all countries to combine in a revolutionary world power for the
abolition of capitalist class rule. In this way socialism ceased to be a
project, a beautiful fantasy or even an experiment of particular groups
of workers in separate countries. As the common program of political
action of the international proletariat, socialism is a _historical
necessity_, since it is a fruit of the economic developmental tendencies
of capitalism.

It is clear then why Marx placed his own economic doctrine outside
official political economy, calling it a "critique of political
economy." The laws of capitalist anarchy and its future downfall that
Marx brought to light are certainly a continuation of the political
economy that was created by bourgeois scholars, but a continuation whose
final results stand in very sharp contrast to the points of departure of
this. The Marxian doctrine is a child of political economy, but a child
that cost its mother her life. Political economy found its completion in
Marx's theory, but also its conclusion as a science. What is still to
follow -- apart from the detailed development of Marx's doctrine -- is
simply the transformation of this doctrine into action, i.e. the
struggle of the international proletariat for the realization of the
socialist economic order. The end of political economy as a science thus
amounts to a world historical act: its transformation into the practice
of a world economy organized according to a plan. The final chapter of
political-economic doctrine is the social revolution of the world
proletariat.

The particular connection between political economy and the modern
working class thereby proves to be a reciprocal relationship. If
political economy, as this was extended by Marx, is on the one hand more
than any other science the indispensable basis for proletarian
enlightenment, on the other hand the class-conscious proletariat of
today forms the only comprehending and receptive audience for the
doctrine of political economy. At an earlier time, it was only with the
decaying ruins of the old feudal society before their eyes that
[François] Quesnay and [Pierre] Boisguilbert in France, Adam Smith and
[David] Ricardo in England, full of pride and enthusiasm for the young
bourgeois society and with a firm belief in the impending thousand-year
rule of the bourgeoisie and its "natural" social harmony, fearlessly
directed their penetrating gaze into the depths of the laws of
capitalism.

Since then, the proletarian class struggle that has risen ever more
powerfully, and especially the June insurrection of the Paris
proletariat, has long since destroyed the faith of bourgeois society in
its divine mandate. Since it has eaten from the tree of knowledge of
modern class antagonisms, it shuns the classical nakedness in which it
showed itself to the creators of its own political economy. It is clear
today however that it was these scientific discoveries from which the
spokesmen for the modern proletariat drew their most deadly weapons.

For several decades now, therefore, it is not just socialist political
economy, but bourgeois political economy as well, in so far as this is
genuinely scientific, that finds a deaf ear among the possessing
classes. Unable to understand the teachings of their own great
ancestors, and still less to accept the Marxian teaching that emerged
from these and tolls the death knell of bourgeois society, today's
bourgeois scholars produce under the name of political economy an
inchoate brew of garbage from all kinds of scientific ideas and
self-interested confusions, no longer pursuing the goal of investigating
the real tendencies of capitalism, but only striving for the opposite
aim of concealing these tendencies in order to defend capitalism as the
best, eternal, and only possible economic order.

Forgotten and betrayed by bourgeois society, scientific political
economy now seeks its audience only among the class-conscious
proletarians, finding with them not just theoretical understanding but
also vigorous fulfillment. It is political economy more than anything
else to which Lassalle's well-known words apply: "If science and the
workers, these two opposite poles of society, embrace one another, they
will overwhelm in their arms all obstacles of civilization."

## 2. Material on economic history (1)

### 2.1

Our knowledge of the earliest and most primitive economic forms is very
recent. In 1847, Marx and Engels wrote in the first classic proclamation
of scientific socialism, the _Communist Manifesto_, that "the history of
all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." But
around the very same time that the creators of scientific socialism
announced this notion, it began to be shaken by new discoveries on all
sides. Almost every year brought formerly unknown insights into the
ancient economic conditions of human society, leading to the conclusion
that there must have been enormous stretches of time in past history in
which there were not yet class struggles, since there was no division
into different social classes, no distinction between rich and poor, and
no private property.

In the years 1851 to 1853, the first of Georg Ludwig von Maurer's
epoch-making works was published in Erlangen, the _Einleitung zur
Geschichte der Mark-, Hof-, Dorf- und Stadt-Verfassung und der
öffentlichen Gewalt_ [Introduction to the History of the Mark, Court,
Village and Town Constitution], casting a new light on the Germanic past
and the social and economic structure of the Middle Ages. Several
decades before, in some particular places -- Germany, the Nordic
countries and Iceland -- people had already stumbled upon remarkable
survivals of age-old agricultural arrangements that indicated the former
existence of common ownership of land in those places, the existence of
an agrarian communism. At first, however, no one knew what to make of
these survivals. According to an earlier point of view, widespread since
the writings of [Justus] Möser and [Nikolaus] Kindlinger, the
cultivation of the soil in Europe was undertaken by individual
households, each of whom was allocated a separate holding that was the
household's private property. Only in the later Middle Ages, it was
believed, were the formerly scattered dwellings brought together into
villages for the sake of greater security, and the formerly separated
household plots bundled together as village ones. Improbable on closer
consideration as this notion appears, the most unbelievable thing is
what has to be assumed about its origin, i.e. that dwellings often quite
far removed from one another were torn down simply to rebuild them in a
different place, and further, that each person voluntarily gave up the
convenient situation of his private fields around his house, which he
was free to cultivate how he liked, in order to receive land that was
divided into narrow strips scattered across open fields, whose
cultivation was completely dependent on his fellow-villagers -- unlikely
as this theory was, it continued all the same to prevail until the mid
nineteenth century. Maurer was the first to combine these various
particular discoveries into a bold and wide-ranging theory, and he
demonstrated conclusively, on the basis of immense factual material and
the profoundest research in old archives, proclamations and legal
institutions, that common property in land did not arise for the first
time in the late Middle Ages, but was rather the typical and general
age-old form of the Germanic settlements in Europe from the very
beginning. Two thousand years ago and still earlier, in that first misty
age of the Germanic people, who did not yet have any written history,
the prevailing conditions were fundamentally different from those of
today. There was then among the Germans no state with written obligatory
laws, no divide between rich and poor, rulers and workers. They formed
free _tribes_ and _clans_, which wandered across Europe for a long time
until they settled first temporarily and eventually permanently. The
first cultivation of land in Germany, as Maurer showed, was undertaken
not by individuals, but by whole clans and tribes, as it was in Iceland
by larger societies known as frändalid and _skulldalid_ -- i.e.
friendships and retinues. The oldest information about the ancient
Germans, which we have from the Romans, authenticates this notion, as
does the examination of institutions that have survived. The first
peoples who populated Germany were migrating pastoralists. Like other
nomads, stock raising and the possession of rich meadows for this was
their main concern. In the long run, however, they could not exist
without agriculture as well, as was also the case with other migrant
peoples old and new. And it was precisely in this condition of nomadic
economy mixed with agriculture, yet with stock-raising still apparently
their main activity and cultivation something subordinate, that Julius
Caesar found the Germanic populations of the Suevi or Swabians. Similar
conditions, customs and institutions were also noted among the Franks,
Allemanni, Vandals and other Germanic tribes. All these Germanic
populations settled as coherent tribes and clans, rapidly cultivating
the land and gathering together whenever more powerful tribes pressed
one way or another, or their pasture was no longer sufficient. Only when
the migrating tribes had become peaceful and none of the others any
longer pressed them, did they remain for a longer time in these
settlements and thus gradually acquired fixed territories. This settling
down, however, whether at an earlier or a later date, whether on virgin
land or on former Roman or Slavic possessions, took place by whole
tribes and clans. In this process, each tribe, and each clan within a
tribe, took over a particular area, which then belonged in common to
everyone involved. The ancient Germans did not know any _meum_ and
_tuum_ in connection with land. Each clan rather formed as it settled a
so-called mark community, which cultivated, partitioned and worked in
common the land that it held. Each individual received by lot a share of
the fields, which he was only given to use for a definite time, the
strictest equality being observed in this sharing of the land. All
economic, legal and general affairs of these mark communities, which
generally also formed a "hundred" of arms-bearing men, were handled by
the assembly of mark members itself, and this also chose the mark leader
and other public officials.

It was only in mountain, forest or marshy districts, where lack of space
or cultivable land made denser settlement impossible, as for example in
the Odenwald, Westphalia and the Alps, that the Germans settled as
individual households. Yet these too formed into communities, with
meadows, woods and pastures rather than fields being the common property
of the whole village, the so-called "common land" (_Allmende_), and all
public affairs being dealt with by the mark community.

The tribe, as the ensemble of many such mark communities, generally
around a hundred, most often came into play only as the highest judicial
and military unit. This mark-community organization, as Maurer showed in
the twelve volumes of his great work, formed the foundation as well as
the smallest cell of the whole social network, from the very start of
the Middle Ages through to quite recent modern times, with feudal
manors, villages and towns, in different modifications, all emerging out
of it, and its ruins can be seen right to the present day in certain
districts of Central and Northern Europe.

When the first discoveries of age-old common property in land in Germany
and the Nordic countries became known, the theory was put forward that
this was a particular and specifically Germanic institution, which could
only be explained in terms of the particularities of the Germanic
national character. Although Maurer himself was quite free from this
national view of Germanic agricultural communism, and pointed out
similar examples among other peoples, it generally remained a fixed
assertion in Germany that the old rural mark community was a peculiarity
of Germanic public and legal relations, an emanation of the "Germanic
spirit." Yet almost at the same time as Maurer's first publications on
the ancient village communism of the Germans, new discoveries came to
light in a quite different part of the European continent. Between 1847
and 1852, the Westphalian Baron von Haxthausen, who had traveled in
Russia in the early 1840s at the invitation of Tsar Nicholas I,
published in Berlin his _Studien über die inneren Zustände, das
Volksleben und insbesondere die ländlichen Einrichtungen Russlands_
[Studies on the Internal Conditions of Russia, the Life of its People
and Especially its Rural Institutions]. From this work the world learned
to its astonishment that in the east of Europe fully analogous
institutions still persisted. The age-old village communism, whose ruins
in Germany had to be unveiled with difficulty from the overlays of later
centuries and millennia, was suddenly found alive and kicking in the
enormous empire to the east. In both the book mentioned above, and in
his later work published in 1866 in Leipzig on _Die ländliche Verfassung
Russlands_ [The Rural Constitution of Russia], Haxthausen demonstrated
that the Russian peasants knew nothing of private property in fields,
meadows and woods, the village as a whole being the real owner of these,
while individual peasant families obtained only temporary use of parcels
of land -- by drawing lots just as with the ancient Germans. In Russia,
at the time when von Haxthausen traveled and investigated, serfdom was
still in full force, and at first glance it was thus all the more
striking that under the rigid surface of a harsh serfdom and a despotic
state apparatus the Russian village presented a little closed-off world
unto itself, with rural communism and the communal handling of all
public affairs by the village assembly, the _mir_. The German discoverer
of these peculiarities explained the Russian rural commune as a product
of the ancient Slavic family community, as this is still found among the
southern Slavs of the Balkan countries and as it fully existed in the
Russian law books of the twelfth century and later. Haxthausen's
discovery was seized on with jubilation by a whole intellectual and
political tendency in Russia, by Slavophilism. This tendency, bent on a
glorification of the Slavic world and its particularities, its "unspent
force" as against the "lazy West" with its Germanic culture, found in
the communist institutions of the Russian peasant community its
strongest point of support over the next two or three decades. Depending
on the respective reactionary or revolutionary branch that
_Slavophilism_ divided into, the rural community was seen either as one
of the three authentic basic Slavic institutions of Russiandom: Greek
Orthodox belief, tsarist absolutism, and peasant-patriarchal village
communism, or conversely as a suitable point of support for introducing
a socialist revolution in Russia in the immediate future, and thus
making much earlier than in Western Europe the leap directly into the
promised land of socialism. The opposing poles of Slavophilism both
completely agreed, however, that the Russian rural community was a
specifically Slavic phenomenon, explicable in terms of the particular
national character of the Slavic tribes.

In the meantime, another moment in the history of the European nations
had appeared, bringing them into contact with new regions of the world
and making them very perceptibly aware of particular public institutions
and age-old cultural forms that belonged neither to the Germanic nor to
the Slavic orbit. This time it was not a matter of scientific
investigations and learned discoveries, but rather the heavy-handed
interests of the European capitalist states and their experiences in
practical _colonial policy_. In the nineteenth century, in the age of
capitalism, European colonial policy struck out on new paths. It was no
longer, as in the sixteenth century with the first attack on the New
World, a matter of the speediest plunder of the treasures and natural
wealth of the newly discovered tropical lands in terms of precious
metals, spices, valuable adornments and slaves, in which the Spanish and
Portuguese had achieved so much. Nor was it a matter of important
opportunities for trade, with various raw materials from overseas
countries being imported for the European market, and valueless trash
and plunder being pressed on the indigenous peoples of these countries,
in which the Dutch of the seventeenth century were the pioneers and
served as a model for the English. Now, as well as these earlier methods
of colonization, which are still in full bloom here and there today and
have never gone out of style, we had a new method of more persistent and
systematic exploitation of the population of the colonies for the
enrichment of the "home country." This was designed to serve two
purposes: first, the actual seizure of land as the most important
material source of wealth in each country, and second, the continuous
taxation of the broad mass of the population. In this double effort, the
European colonial powers necessarily came up against a remarkable
rock-hard obstacle in all these exotic lands, i.e. the particular
property institutions of the indigenous peoples, which opposed a most
stubborn resistance to plundering by the Europeans. In order to seize
land from the hands of its former proprietors, it was first necessary to
establish who these proprietors were. In order not just to decree taxes,
but also to be able to collect them, it had to be established who was
liable for such taxes. Here the Europeans in their colonies came upon
relationships quite foreign to them, which directly overturned all their
notions of the sanctity of private property. The English in South Asia
had the same experience of this as the French did in North Africa.

The conquest of India by the English, begun in the early seventeenth
century with the gradual seizure of the entire coastline and Bengal,
only ended in the nineteenth century with the subjection of the highly
important Punjab in the north. After political subjection, however, came
the difficult work of the systematic exploitation of India. Everywhere
they went, the English experienced the greatest surprise: they found the
most varied peasant communities, large and small, which had occupied the
land for millennia, cultivating rice and living in quiet, orderly
conditions, but -- oh horror! -- no private owner of the land was to be
found anywhere in these tranquil villages. No matter whom you asked, no
one could call the land or the parcel he worked _his own_, i.e. no one
was allowed to sell, lease, mortgage it or pawn it for arrears of
taxation. All the members of these communities, which sometimes embraced
whole large clans, sometimes only a few families who had branched off
from the clan, stuck doggedly together, and ties of blood were
everything to them, while individual ownership was nothing. Indeed, the
English to their amazement were forced to discover on the banks of the
Indus and the Ganges similar models of rural communism against which
even the communist customs of the ancient Germanic mark or Slavic
village community seemed almost like the fall into private property.

As the English tax authorities reported from India in 1845, "We can see
no permanent shares. Each possesses the share that he cultivates only as
long as the agricultural work continues. If a share is left untilled, it
falls back into common land and can be taken over by anyone else, on
condition that he cultivates it."

At the same time, a government report on the administration of Punjab
from 1849 to 1851 stated:

>It is highly interesting to observe how strong the sentiment of blood
>kinship is in this community, and the consciousness of stemming from a
>common ancestor. Public opinion so strictly insists on the maintenance
>of this system that we not uncommonly see how persons are allowed into
>it even if their ancestors had not participated in this common
>ownership for one or even two generations.

"With this form of possession of land," wrote the report of the English
state council on the Indian clan community, "no member of the clan can
prove that he owns this or that part of the common land, but only that
he possesses it for temporary use. The products of the common economy
are placed in a common bank, from which all needs are met." Here,
therefore, we have no distribution of the fields at all, even for the
agricultural season; the peasants of the community possess and work
their fields undividedly and in common, they bring the harvest into a
common village store, which the capitalist eye of the English had to see
as a "bank," and fraternally meet their modest needs from the fruits of
their common labor. In the northwestern corner of the Punjab, close to
the border with Afghanistan, other very remarkable customs were
encountered, which scorned any notion of private property. Here, while
the fields were indeed divided and even periodically changed around, it
was not -- what a miracle! -- individual families that exchanged their
plots with one another, instead whole villages rotated their land every
five years, with the whole community migrating. As the English tax
commissioner James wrote from India in 1852 to his superiors: "I cannot
fail to mention a most peculiar custom that has persisted in some
districts until today: I mean the periodic exchange of lands between
individual villages and their subsections. In some districts only fields
are exchanged, in others even dwelling houses."

Once again, therefore, we have the particular characteristics of a
certain family of peoples, this time an "Indian" peculiarity. The
communist institutions of the Indian village community, however,
indicate their traditional age-old character both by their geographical
location and particularly by the strength of blood ties and kinship
relations. It was precisely the earliest forms of communism preserved in
the oldest inhabited parts of India, the north-west, that clearly
indicated the conclusion that communal property along with strong ties
of kinship was attributable to thousand-year-old customs, linked with
the first settlements of the immigrant Indians in their new home,
present-day India. Sir Henry Maine, professor of comparative law at
Oxford and former member of the government of India, took the Indian
rural community as the subject of his lectures as early as 1871, placing
it alongside the mark communities that Maurer had demonstrated in
Germany and [Erwin] von Nasse in England, as age-old institutions of the
same character as the Germanic rural communities.

The venerable age of these communist institutions also struck the amazed
English in a further way, i.e. by the stubbornness with which they
resisted the tax and administration skills of the colonizers. It took a
struggle of decades, with every kind of coup de main, enormity, and
unscrupulous attack on the people's old laws and prevailing notions of
right, before they could bring about an incurable confusion of all
property relations, general insecurity and the ruin of the great mass of
peasants. The old ties were broken, the quiet seclusion of village
communism torn asunder and replaced by discord, disharmony, inequality
and exploitation. The result was enormous _latifundia_ on the one hand,
and an immense mass of millions of dispossessed peasant tenants on the
other. Private property celebrated its entry in India, and with it
typhus and scurvy due to hunger became a constant presence in the
marshes of the Ganges.

But even if, in the wake of the discoveries of the English colonizers in
India, this ancient rural communism, already now found among three such
major branches of the great Indo-Germanic family of peoples -- Germanic,
Slavic and Indian -- was seen as an ancient peculiarity of the
Indo-Germanic group of peoples, uncertain as this ethnographic concept
may be, the concurrent discoveries of the French in Africa already went
far beyond this orbit. What we had here were discoveries that showed
among the Arabs and Berbers of North Africa exactly the same
institutions as had been found at the heart of Europe and on the Asian
continent.

Among the Arabic nomadic herdsmen, land was the property of the clan.
This clan property, so the French scholar [Rodolpho] Dareste wrote in
1852, was handed down from generation to generation, and no individual
Arab could point to a piece of land and say: This is mine.

Among some branches of the Kabyles, who had been completely Arabized,
the clan associations had already very much decayed, yet the power of
the clans still remained strong: they took common responsibility for
taxes; they bought livestock together for division among the different
branches of a family as food; in all disputes over possession of land
the clan council was the highest authority; settlement among the Kabyles
always required the agreement of the clans; and the clan council
likewise disposed of uncultivated lands. The prevailing rule, however,
was the undivided property of a family, which did not just include in
the present-day European sense an individual couple, but was rather a
typically patriarchal family, like that of the ancient Israelites as
described in the Bible -- a large circle of kinship, consisting of
father, mother, sons and their wives, children and grandchildren,
uncles, aunts, nephews and cousins. In this circle, said another French
researcher, [Aristide] Letourneux, in 1873, it was the custom for the
oldest family member to dispose of the undivided property, though he was
in fact _chosen_ for this office by the family, while in all more
important cases, in particular where the sale and purchase of land was
involved, the whole family council had to be consulted.

This was the situation with the population of Algeria at the time that
the French colonized it. France had the same experience in North Africa
as the English had in India. Everywhere, the European colonial policy
met with stubborn resistance on the part of age-old social associations
and their communistic institutions, which protected individuals from the
exploitative grip of European capital and European financial policy.

At the same time as these new discoveries, a half-forgotten memory from
the first days of European colonialism and its quest for booty in the
New World now appeared in a new light. The yellowed chronicles of the
Spanish state archives and monasteries preserved the curious tale from
centuries ago of the miraculous South American country where already in
the age of the great discoveries the Spanish conquistadores had found
the most remarkable institutions. The hazy reports of this South
American land of marvels found their way into European literature
already in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, reports of the
empire of the Incas, which the Spanish had discovered in what is now
Peru and where the people lived with complete common property under the
paternal theocratic government of generous despots. The fantastic ideas
of this legendary communist realm in Peru persisted so stubbornly that
in 1875 a German writer could refer to the Inca kingdom as "almost
unique in human history" in being a social monarchy on a theocratic
foundation, in which "the greater part of what the Social Democrats
strive for today as their conceived ideal, but at no time have
achieved," was carried out in practice. In the meantime, however, more
exact material on this remarkable land and its customs had appeared.

In 1840, an important original report by Alonzo de Zurita, one-time
auditor to the royal council in Mexico, on administration and agrarian
relations in the former Spanish colonies, was published in French
translation. And in the mid-nineteenth century, even the Spanish
government was stirred to rescue old information about the conquest and
administration of Spain's American possessions from the archives and
bring it to light. This made a new and important documentary
contribution to the material on social conditions of ancient
precapitalist stages of culture in overseas lands.

Already on the basis of Zurita's reports, the Russian scholar Maksim
Kovalevsky concluded in the 1870s that the legendary realm of the Incas
in Peru had been simply a country in which the same age-old agrarian
communist relations prevailed that Maurer had already found in many
places among the ancient Germans, and that were the predominant form not
just in Peru but also in Mexico and throughout the new regions of the
world conquered by the Spanish. Later publications made possible an
exact investigation of the old Peruvian agrarian relations, and revealed
a new picture of primitive rural communism -- again in a new part of the
world, among a different race, at a quite different cultural stage and
in a quite different era, than had been the case with previous
discoveries.

Here we had an age-old agrarian communist constitution, which --
prevailing from time immemorial among the Peruvian tribes -- was still
fully alive and well at the time of the Spanish invasion. Here too, a
kinship association, the clan, was the only proprietor of the land in
each village, or in a few villages together, and here too, the arable
land was divided into lots and distributed annually by lot to the
members of the village; here too public affairs were settled by the
village community, which also elected the village head. Indeed, on the
distant continent of South America, among the Amerindians, living traces
were found of a communism so far-reaching as seemed quite unknown in
Europe: there were immense common buildings, where whole clans lived in
common quarters with a common burial place. It was said of one such
quarter that it was occupied by more than 4,000 men and women. The
capital of the so-called Inca emperor, the town of Cuzco, consisted of
several such common quarters, each of which bore the particular name of
a clan.

From the mid-nineteenth century, therefore, through to the 1870s, a
wealth of material came to light that eroded and soon tore to shreds the
old idea of the eternal character of private property and its existence
from the beginning of the world. After agrarian communism had been
discovered as a peculiarity of the Germanic people, then as something
Slavic, Indian, Arab-Kabyle, or ancient Mexican, as the marvel state of
the Peruvian Inca and in many more "specific" races of people in all
parts of the world, the conclusion was unavoidable that this village
communism was not at all a "peculiarity" of a particular race of people
or part of the world, but rather the general and typical form of human
society at a certain level of cultural development. The first reaction
of official bourgeois science, i.e. political economy, was obstinately
to resist this knowledge. The English school of Smith and Ricardo, which
prevailed throughout Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century,
simply denied the possibility of common property in land. Just as
earlier on the crude ignorance and narrow-mindedness of the first
Spanish, Portuguese, French and Dutch conquerors in newly discovered
America completely failed to understand the agrarian relations of the
indigenous population, and in the absence of private owners simply
declared the whole land "property of the emperor," available to the
exchequer, so in the age of bourgeois "enlightenment," the great
luminaries of political-economic learning proceeded in the same way. In
the seventeenth century, for example, the French missionary
[Jean-Antoine] Dubois wrote about the Indians: "The Indians possess no
property in land. The fields that they work are the property of the
Mongol government." And a medical doctor of the Montpellier faculty,
François Bernier, who traveled the lands of the great Mogul in Asia and
published in Amsterdam in 1699 a very well-known description of these
countries, exclaimed in amazement: "These three states, Turkey, Persia,
and India, have denied the concept of _meum_ and _tuum_ in relation to
the ownership of land, a concept that is the foundation of everything
fine and good in the world." Exactly this same crass ignorance and lack
of understanding of everything that appeared different from capitalist
culture was shown by the scholar James Mill, father of the celebrated
John Stuart Mill, when he wrote in his history of British India: "On the
basis of all the facts we have considered, we can only reach one
conclusion, that landownership in India fell to the conqueror, for if we
were to assume that he was not the landowner, we would not be in a
position to say who the owner was."

The idea that ownership of land simply belonged to the Indian peasant
communities who had worked it for millennia, that there could be a
country, a great social culture, in which land was not a means for
exploiting the labor of others, but simply the foundation of the
existence of working people themselves, was something that the brain of
a great scholar of the English bourgeoisie was unable to accept. This
almost touching limitation of the intellectual horizon to the four walls
of the capitalist economy only shows that the official science of the
bourgeois enlightenment has an infinitely narrower horizon and
cultural-historical understanding than the Romans had two thousand years
ago, with their generals like Caesar, and historians like Tacitus,
handing down to us extremely valuable insights and descriptions on the
economic and social relations of the Germanic barbarians that they saw
as strange and savage.

Just as today, so previously too, bourgeois political economy as the
intellectual defense forces of the prevailing form of exploitation had
less understanding than any other science of different forms of culture
and economy, and it was reserved for branches of science that were
somewhat more removed from the direct conflict of interest and struggle
between capital and labor, to recognize in the communist institutions of
earlier times a generally prevailing form of economic and cultural
development at a certain stage. It was jurists such as Maurer and
Kovalevsky, and the English law professor and state councilor for India,
Sir Henry Maine, who first came to understand agrarian communism as an
international primitive form of development that appeared among all
races and in all parts of the world. And it was a legally trained
sociologist, the American Lewis Henry Morgan, who discovered the
necessary social structure of primitive society as the basis for this
economic form.

The great role of kinship ties among the ancient communist village
communities struck scholars, both in India and in Algeria, as well as
among the Slavs. In the wake of Maurer's studies, it was established in
the case of the Germans that it was always in the form of clans, i.e.
kinship groups, that they pursued their settlement in Europe. The
history of the antique Greeks and Romans showed all along the line that
the clan had always played the greatest role for them, as a social
group, an economic unit, a legal institution and a closed circle of
religious practice. Finally, almost all reports of travelers in
so-called savage countries agreed remarkably on the fact that, the more
primitive a people was, the greater the role of kinship ties in the life
of that people, and the more that these governed their economic, social
and religious relations and ideas.

Scientific research was thus presented with a new and highly important
problem. What actually were these kinship ties that were so important in
ancient times, how had they come to be formed, what was their connection
with economic communism and economic development in general? On all
these questions, it was Morgan who first offered an insight in his
epoch-making book _Ancient Society_. Morgan, who had spent a large part
of his life among an Indian tribe of Iroquois in the state of New York,
and had made a most thorough study of the conditions of this primitive
hunting people, came by comparing his own results with facts known about
other primitive peoples to a new and wide-ranging theory about the forms
of development of human society over the immense expanses of time that
preceded any historical information. Morgan's pioneering ideas, which
retain their full validity today despite the wealth of new material that
has since appeared and corrected several details of his presentation,
can be summarized as follows.

1: Morgan was the first to bring scientific order into prehistoric
cultural history, both by defining its particular stages and also by
revealing the underlying driving force of this development. Until then,
the immense temporal extents of social life that preceded any written
history, as well as the social relations of the primitive peoples still
living today, with all their motley wealth of forms and stages, formed
an uncharted chaos, from which only individual chapters and fragments
had been brought to light by scientific research here and there. In
particular, the descriptions "savagery" and "barbarism," which were
customarily used as a summary description of these conditions, had only
a meaning as _negative_ concepts, descriptions of the lack of everything
that was considered characteristic of "civilization," i.e. of
well-mannered human life as seen through contemporary eyes. From this
point of view, properly mannered social life, appropriate to human
dignity, began only with those conditions described in written history.
Everything that belonged to "savagery" and "barbarism" indifferently
formed only an inferior and embarrassing stage prior to civilization, a
half-animal existence which present-day civilized humanity could only
regard with condescending disparagement. Just as the official
representatives of the Christian church regard all primitive and
pre-Christian religions as simply a long series of errors in the quest
of humanity for the only true religion, so for the political economists
all primitive forms of economy were merely unsuccessful attempts that
preceded the discovery of the one true form of economy: that of private
property and exploitation with which written history and civilization
begins. Morgan dealt this conception a decisive blow by portraying the
whole of primitive cultural history as an equally valid -- indeed an
infinitely more important -- part in the uninterrupted developmental
sequence of humanity, infinitely more important both on account of its
infinitely longer duration in comparison with the tiny section of
written history, and also on account of the decisive acquisitions of
culture that were made precisely in that long dawn of human social
existence. By filling the descriptions "savagery," "barbarism" and
"civilization" for the first time with a positive content, Morgan made
them into precise scientific concepts and applied them as tools of
scientific research. For Morgan, savagery, barbarism and civilization
are three sections of cultural development, separated from each other by
quite particular material characteristics, and themselves each breaking
down into a lower, middle and upper stage, which again are distinguished
by particular concrete achievements and advances. Pedantic know-alls
today may rail that the middle stage of savagery could not simply begin,
as Morgan believed, with fishing, the upper stage with the invention of
the bow and arrow, and so on, since in several cases the sequence was
the other way round, and in other cases was dependent on natural
conditions -- objections that can indeed be made against any historical
classification, if this is conceived as a rigid schema of absolute
validity, an iron fetter on knowledge instead of a living and flexible
guideline. Morgan's epoch-making service remains exactly the same, that
he originated the investigation of prehistory with this first scientific
classification of preconditions, just as it is Linnaeus's service to
have supplied the first scientific classification of plants. Yet there
is one great difference. [Carl] Linnaeus, as we well know, took as the
basis of his systematization of plants a very usable but purely external
characteristic -- the sexual organs of plants -- and this first
makeshift had later, as Linnaeus himself well recognized, to make way
for a deeper natural classification from the standpoint of the
developmental history of the plant world. Morgan, on the contrary, made
his most fruitful contribution to research precisely by the choice of
the basic principle on which he built his system: he made the starting
point of his classification the proposition that it is the kind of
social labor, _production_, that in each historical epoch from the first
beginnings of culture plays the main role in determining human social
relations, and that its decisive advances are likewise so many
milestones in this development.

2: Morgan's second great achievement bears on the family relations of
primitive society. Here too, on the basis of comprehensive material that
he obtained by an international survey, he laid down the first
scientifically founded sequence of developmental forms of the family,
from the earliest forms of quite primitive society through to today's
prevailing monogamy -- i.e. legally established permanent marriage of a
single couple, with the dominant position of the man. Of course, here
too material has emerged to require several corrections of detail to
Morgan's developmental schema of the family. The basic lines of his
system, however, as the first ladder of human family forms derived
strictly from the idea of development, from the grey of prehistory
through to the present, remain a lasting contribution to the treasury of
social science. This area, too, Morgan enriched not simply by his
systematic conception, but also by a fundamental idea of genius about
the relationship between the family relations of a society and its
prevailing kinship system. Morgan was the first to draw attention to the
striking fact that among many primitive peoples the actual relations of
sexuality and descent, i.e. the actual family, do not coincide with the
kinship categories that people ascribe one another, or with the
reciprocal duties that derive from these ascriptions. He was the first
to find an explanation for this puzzling phenomenon purely in
materialist and dialectical terms. "The family," he says, "represents an
active principle. It is never stationary, but advances from a lower to a
higher form as society advances from a lower to a higher condition....
Systems of consanguinity, on the contrary, are passive; recording the
progress made by the family at long intervals apart, and only changing
radically when the family has radically changed."

We find, then, that among primitive peoples, systems of consanguinity
remain valid that correspond to an earlier and already superseded form
of family, just as people's ideas and notions generally remain tied for
a long while to conditions that have been superseded by the actual
material development of society.

3: On the basis of the developmental history of family relations, Morgan
offered the first exhaustive investigation of the ancient clan
associations that are found at the beginning of historical tradition
among all civilized peoples -- among the Greeks and Romans, the Celts
and Germans, the ancient Israelites -- and that still exist among most
primitive peoples that survive today. He showed that these associations
resting on blood relationship and common descent are on the one hand
only a high stage in the development of the family, while on the other
hand they are the basis of the whole social life of peoples -- in those
long stretches of time when there was not yet a state in the modern
sense, i.e. no organization of political compulsion on a fixed
territorial basis. Each tribe, which itself consisted of a certain
number of clan associations, or, as the Romans called them, _gentes_,
had its own territory, which belonged to it as a whole, and in each
tribe the clan association was the unit in which a common household was
run communistically, in which there were no rich and poor, no idlers and
workers, no masters and slaves, and where all public affairs were dealt
with by the free vote and decision of all. As a living example of these
relations that all peoples of present-day civilization went through,
Morgan described in detail the _gens_ organization of the American
Indians, which was in full bloom at the time of the conquest of America
by the Europeans:

>All the members of an Iroquois gens were personally free, and they were
>bound to defend each other's freedom; they were equal in privileges and
>in personal rights, the sachem and chiefs claiming no superiority; and
>they were a brotherhood bound together by the ties of kin. Liberty,
>equality, and fraternity, though never formulated, were cardinal
>principles of the gens. These facts are material, because the gens was
>the unit of a social and governmental system, the foundation upon which
>Indian society was organized. A structure composed of such units would
>of necessity bear the impress of their character, for as the unit so
>the compound. It serves to explain that sense of independence and
>personal dignity universally an attribute of Indian character.

4: The gentile organization led social development to the threshold of
civilization, which Morgan characterizes as that brief recent epoch of
cultural history in which private property arose on the ruins of
communism and with it a public organization of compulsion: the state and
the exclusive dominance of man over woman in the state, in property
right and in the family. In this relatively brief historical period fall
the greatest and most rapid advances in production, science and art, but
also the deepest fissure of society by class antagonism, the greatest
misery for the mass of the people and their greatest enslavement. Here
is Morgan's own judgment on our present-day civilization, with which he
concludes the results of his classical investigation:

>Since the advent of civilization, the outgrowth of property has been so
>immense, its forms so diversified, its uses so expanding and its
>management so intelligent in the interests of its owners, that it has
>become, on the part of the people, an unmanageable power. The human
>mind stands bewildered in the presence of its own creation. The time
>will come, nevertheless, when human intelligence will rise to the
>mastery over property, and define the relations of the state to the
>property it protects, as well as the obligations and the limits of the
>rights of its owners. The interests of society are paramount to
>individual interests, and the two must be brought into just and
>harmonious relations. A mere property career is not the final destiny
>of mankind, if progress is to be the law of the future as it has been
>of the past. The time which has passed away since civilization began is
>but a fragment of the past duration of man's existence; and but a
>fragment of the ages yet to come. The dissolution of society bids fair
>to become the termination of a career of which property is the end and
>aim; because such a career contains the elements of self-destruction.
>Democracy in government, brotherhood in society, equality in rights and
>privileges, and universal education, foreshadow the next higher plane
>of society to which experience, intelligence and knowledge are steadily
>tending. It will be a revival, in a higher form, of the liberty,
>equality and fraternity of the ancient gentes.

Morgan's achievement had wide-ranging significance for the knowledge of
economic history. He placed the ancient communistic economy, which up
till then had only been discovered in isolated individual cases and not
explained, on the broad footing of a consistent and general cultural
development, and particularly of the gens constitution. Primitive
communism, with the democracy and social equality that went together
with it, were thereby shown to be the cradle of social development. By
this expansion of the horizon of the prehistoric past, he showed the
whole present-day civilization, with private property, class rule, male
supremacy, state compulsion and compulsory marriage, as simply a brief
transition phase that, just as it arose itself from the dissolution of
age-old communist society, is bound to make way in turn in the future
for higher social forms. In this way, however, Morgan gave powerful new
support to scientific socialism. While Marx and Engels showed by way of
the economic analysis of capitalism the unavoidable historical
transition of society to the communist world economy in the very near
future, thus giving socialist efforts a firm scientific basis, Morgan in
a certain sense supplied the work of Marx and Engels with a full and
powerful underpinning, by demonstrating that a communist and democratic
society, even if in different and more primitive forms, embraced the
whole long past of human cultural history prior to present-day
civilization. In this way, the noble survivals of the dim past offered a
hand to the revolutionary efforts of the future, the circle of knowledge
was harmoniously closed, and from this perspective the present-day world
of class rule and exploitation, which presented itself as the one and
only world of civilization, the highest aim of world history, appeared
as a tiny transitional stage on the great forward march of human
culture.

### 2.2

Morgan's "ancient society" formed as it were a subsequent introduction
to the _Communist Manifesto_ of Marx and Engels. It was only natural
that it should provoke a reaction in bourgeois science. Within two or
three decades from the mid-nineteenth century, the concept of primitive
communism made its entry into science on all sides. As long as it was a
question of honorable "Germanic antiquity," "Slavic tribal
peculiarities', or the historical excavation of the Peruvian Inca state
and the like, these discoveries did not overstep the realm of scientific
curiosities, without contemporary significance or any direct connection
to the interests and struggles of today's bourgeois society. So much so
that staunch conservative or moderately liberal statesmen such as Ludwig
von Maurer or Sir Henry Maine could claim the greatest merit for these
discoveries. Soon, however, such a connection was established, in two
different directions. Colonial policy, as we have seen, involved a
collision of palpable material interests between the bourgeois world and
primitive communist conditions. The more that the capitalist regime
began to establish itself as all-powerful in Western Europe after the
mid-nineteenth century, in the wake of the storms of the February
revolution of 1848, the sharper this collision grew. At the same time,
and precisely after the February revolution, a new enemy within the camp
of bourgeois society, the revolutionary workers' movement, played an
ever-greater role. After the June days of 1848 in Paris, the "red
specter" never again vanished from the public stage, and in 1871 it
reappeared in the dazzling light of the struggle of the Commune, to the
fury of the French and international bourgeoisie. In the light of these
brutal class struggles, primitive communism as the latest discovery of
scientific research showed a dangerous face. The bourgeoisie, clearly
affected in their class interests, scented an obscure connection between
the ancient communist survivals that put up stubborn resistance in the
colonial countries to the forward march of the profit-hungry
"Europeanization" of the indigenous peoples, and the new gospel of
revolutionary impetuousness of the proletarian mass in the old
capitalist countries. When the French National Assembly was deciding the
fate of the unfortunate Arabs of Algeria in 1873, with a law on the
compulsory introduction of private property, it was repeatedly said, in
a gathering where the cowardice and bloodlust of the conquerors of the
Paris Commune still trembled, that the ancient common property of the
Arabs must at any cost be destroyed, "as a form that supports communist
tendencies in people's minds." In Germany, meanwhile, the glories of the
new German Empire, the "founders' time" and the first capitalist crash
of the 1870s, with Bismarck's "blood and iron" regime and the
anti-Socialist law, greatly inflamed class struggles and made even
scientific research uncomfortable. The unmatched growth of German Social
Democracy, as the theories of Marx and Engels become flesh, sharpened to
an extraordinary degree the class instinct of bourgeois science in
Germany, and a reaction against the theories of primitive communism now
set in most forcefully. Cultural historians such as [Julius] Lippert and
[Heinrich] Schurtz, political economists such as [Karl] Bücher,
sociologists such as [Carl Nicolai] Starcke, [Edward] Westermarck and
[Ernst] Grosse, now united in a keen combat against the doctrine of
primitive communism, and particularly Morgan's theory of the development
of the family and the previously universal prevalence of a kinship
constitution with equality between the sexes and general democracy. This
Herr Starcke, for example, in his _Primitive Familie_ of 1888, called
Morgan's hypotheses about kinship systems a "crazy dream ... not to say
a feverish delusion." But more serious scholars, too, such as Lippert,
author of the best cultural history that we have, took the field against
Morgan. Basing themselves on obsolete and superficial reports of
eighteenth-century missionaries who were completely untrained in
economics or ethnology, and themselves quite ignorant of Morgan's
wide-ranging studies, Lippert described the economic conditions of the
North American Indians, the very same people whose life with its finely
developed social organization Morgan had penetrated more thoroughly than
anyone else, as evidence that among hunting peoples in general there is
no common regulation of production and no "provision" for the totality
and for the future, rather nothing but a lack of regulation and
consciousness. The foolish distortion by narrow-minded European
missionaries of the communist institutions that actually existed among
the Indians of North America was taken over by Lippert quite
uncritically, as shown for example by the following quotation he offers
from the history of the mission of the Evangelical Brothers among the
Indians of North America by [Georg Heinrich] Loskiel in 1789. "Many
among them" (the American Indians), says our excellently oriented
missionary,

>are so lethargic that they do not plant for themselves, but rather rely
>completely on others' not refusing to share their stores with them.
>Since in this way the more diligent do not benefit from their work any
>more than the idlers, as time goes on ever less is planted. If a hard
>winter comes, so that deep snow prevents them from going hunting, it is
>easy for a general famine to arise, which often leads to many people
>dying. Hunger then leads them to eat the roots of grass and the inner
>bark of trees, particularly of young oaks.

"By a natural connection, therefore," Lippert adds to the words of his
source, "the relapse into earlier carelessness leads to a relapse to an
earlier way of life." And in this Indian society, in which no one "may
refuse" to share his store of provisions with others, and in which an
"Evangelical Brother" constructs in a quite evidently arbitrary fashion
the inevitable division between the "diligent" and the "idlers" along
European lines, Lippert finds the best proof _against_ primitive
communism:

>Still less at such a stage does the older generation care to equip the
>younger generation for life. The Indian is already far removed from
>primitive man. As soon as someone has a tool, he has the concept of
>ownership, but only limited to this. This concept the Indian already
>has at the lower stage; _but in this primitive ownership any communist
>trait is lacking; the development begins with the opposite_. [Emphasis
>R.L.]

Professor Bücher opposed to the primitive communist economy his "theory
of individual search for food" on the part of primitive peoples, and the
"immeasurable stretches of time" in which "people existed without
working." For the cultural historian Schurtz, however, Professor Bücher
with his "insight of genius" is the prophet that he follows blindly. The
most typical and energetic representative of reaction, however, against
the dangerous doctrines of primitive communism and the gentile
constitution, and against Morgan as the "church father of German
socialism," is Herr Ernst Grosse. At first sight, Grosse is himself a
supporter of the materialist conception of history, i.e. he attributes
various legal, kinship and intellectual forms of social life to the
prevailing relations of production as their determining factors. "Only a
few cultural historians," he says in his _Anfänge der Kunst_ [The
Beginnings of the Arts] published in 1894,

>seem to have grasped the full significance of production. It is however
>far more easy to underestimate this than to overestimate it. Economic
>activity is likewise the center of life of every cultural form; it
>influences all the other factors of culture in the deepest and most
>irresistible way, while being itself determined not so much by cultural
>factors as by natural ones -- geographical and meteorological. It would
>be correct in a certain sense to call the form of production the

>sense that these other branches have arisen from the stem of
>production, but rather because, despite their independent origins, they

>of the prevailing economic factor.

It would seem at first sight that Grosse himself had learned his main
ideas from the "church fathers of German Social Democracy," Marx and
Engels, even if he understandably takes care not to betray with a single
word from which scientific corner he has taken over ready-made his
superiority over "most cultural historians." Indeed, he is even "more
Catholic than the pope" in relation to the materialist conception of
history. Whereas Engels -- along with Marx the joint creator of the
materialist conception of history -- assumed for the development of
family relations in primitive times through to the formation of today's
legally accredited compulsory marriage a progress of forms independent
of economic relations, founded on the interest of preserving and
multiplying the human species, Grosse goes a great deal further. He puts
forward the theory that at all times the form of family is simply the
direct product of the economic relations prevailing at the time.
"Nowhere," he says, "does the cultural significance of production appear
with such clarity as in the history of the family. The strange forms of
human families, which have inspired sociologists to still stranger
hypotheses, appear surprisingly understandable as soon as they are
considered in connection with the forms of production."

Grosse's book published in 1896, _Die Formen der Familie und die Formen
der Wirthschaft_ [The Forms of Family and the Forms of Economy], is
devoted completely to proving this idea. At the same time, however,
Grosse is a determined opponent of the doctrine of primitive communism.
He too seeks to demonstrate that human social development began not with
common property but with private property; he too strives, like Lippert
and Bücher, to show from his standpoint that the further we go back in
ancient history, the more exclusively and all-powerfully the
"individual" and his "individual ownership" prevails. Of course, the
discoveries of primitive village communities in all parts of the world,
and clan associations -- or kinship groups as Grosse calls them -- in
connection with these, cannot be simply denied. It is just that Grosse
has the clan organization -- and this is his own particular theory --
emerge as the framework of a communist economy only at a particular
stage of development, i.e. with the lower agricultural stage, to
dissolve again at the stage of higher agriculture and make way once more
for "individual ownership." In this way, Grosse triumphantly turns the
historical perspective established by Morgan and Marx directly on its
head. According to this, communism was the cradle of human cultural
development, the form of economic relations that accompanied this
development for measureless extents of time, only to decline and
dissolve with civilization and make way for private property, this epoch
of civilization facing in turn a rapid process of dissolution and a
return to communism in the higher form of a socialist social order.
According to Grosse, it was private property that accompanied the rise
and development of culture, making way temporarily for communism only at
a particular stage, that of lower agriculture. According to Marx and
Engels, and likewise Morgan, the beginning and end point of cultural
history is common property and social solidarity; according to Grosse
and his colleagues of bourgeois science, it is the "individual" and his
private property. But this is not enough. Grosse is not only an express
opponent of Morgan and primitive communism, but of the whole
developmental theory in the realm of social life, and pours scorn on
those childish minds who seek to bring all phenomena of social life into
a developmental series and conceive this as a unitary process, an
advance of humanity from lower to higher forms of life. This fundamental
idea, which serves as a basis for the whole of modern social science in
general, and particularly for the conception of history and doctrine of
scientific socialism, Herr Grosse combats as a typical bourgeois
scholar, with all the power at his command. "_Humanity_," he proclaims
and emphasizes, "_in no way moves along a single line in a single
direction; rather, its paths and goals are just as varied as are the
conditions of life of different peoples_." In the person of Grosse,
therefore, bourgeois social science, in its reaction against the
revolutionary consequences of its own discoveries, has reached the same
point that bourgeois vulgar economics reached in its reaction to
classical economics: the denial of the very lawfulness of social
development. Let us examine this strange historical "materialism" of the
latest champion to defeat Marx, Engels and Morgan.

Grosse has a good deal to say about "production," he is always referring
to the "character of production" as the determining factor that
influences the whole of culture. But what does he understand by
production and its character?

>The economic form that prevails or dominates in a social group, the way
>in which the members of this group gain their subsistence, is a fact
>whose main features can be directly observed with sufficient assurance
>everywhere. We may remain much in doubt as to the religious and social
>notions of the Australians, but not the slightest doubt is possible as
>to the character of their production: the Australians are hunters and
>gatherers of plants. It is perhaps impossible to penetrate the mental
>cultural of the ancient Peruvians, but the fact that the citizens of
>the Inca empire were an agricultural people is open for anyone to see.

By "production" and its "character," therefore, Grosse simply means the
particular main source of a people's sustenance. Hunting, fishing,
pastoralism, agriculture -- these are the "relations of production" that
have a determining effect on all other cultural relations of a people.
The first thing to note here is that, if no more than this meager
discovery is involved, Herr Grosse's exaggeration about "most cultures"
is certainly quite unfounded. The knowledge that the particular main
source that a given people draw on for their sustenance is
extraordinarily important for their cultural development, is in no way
Herr Grosse's spanking new discovery, but rather an age-old and
honorable element in all doctrines of cultural history. This knowledge
led in particular to the conventional division of peoples into hunters,
pastoralists and agriculturalists, which is found in all cultural
histories and which Herr Grosse finally adopts himself after a great
deal of to-ing and fro-ing. But this knowledge is not only quite old, it
is also quite false -- at least in the bland version of it that Grosse
offers. If all we know is that a people lives from hunting, pastoralism
or agriculture, we do not yet know anything about its relations of
production or the rest of its culture. The Hottentots in Southwest
Africa today, whose herds, which formed their previous source of
livelihood, have been taken away by the Germans and who have been
supplied with modern shotguns, have been forcibly made into hunters. The
relations of production of this "hunting people," however, have nothing
at all in common with those of the Indian hunters of California, who
still live in their primitive seclusion from the world, and are
themselves very different from the hunting companies of Canada, which
supply American and European capitalists with tradable animal pelts for
the fur trade. The pastoralists of Peru, who before the Spanish invasion
kept their llamas communistically in the cordilleras under Inca rule,
the Arab nomads with their patriarchal herds in Africa or the Arabian
peninsula, the present-day peasants in the Swiss, Bavarian and Tyrolean
alps, who pursue their long-established "_Alpenbücher_" in the midst of
the capitalist world, the half-wild Roman slaves who kept the enormous
herds of their masters in the wastes of Apulia, the farmers in today's
Argentina who fatten up immense herds for the Ohio slaughterhouses and
processed-meat factories -- these are all examples of "pastoralism,"
each presenting a totally different type of production and culture. As
for "agriculture," this embraces such a broad scale of the most varying
kinds of economy and levels of culture -- from the ancient Indian clan
community to the modern latifundium, from the tiny peasant holding to
the knightly estates east of the Elbe, from the English tenant system to
Romanian "_jobbaggio_," from Chinese peasant horticulture to Brazilian
slave plantations, from the women's hoe-tillage of Haiti to the giant
North American farms with steam and electric machinery -- so that Herr
Grosse's showy revelations about the significance of production only
display a glaring lack of understanding of what "production" really
means. It was precisely against this kind of crude and coarse
"materialism," which takes into consideration only the external natural
conditions of production and culture, and which found its best and most
exhaustive expression in the English sociologist [Henry Thomas] Buckle,
that Marx and Engels directed themselves. What is decisive for the
economic and cultural conditions of people is not the external natural
source of their sustenance, but rather the connections that people form
between one another in their labor. The _social_ connections of
production determine the question: what form of production prevails
among a given people? Only when _this_ aspect of production has been
thoroughly grasped is it possible to understand the determining
influences of a people's production on its family relations, its
concepts of right, its religious ideas and the development of its arts.
Most European observers, however, find it extraordinarily difficult to
penetrate the social relations of production of so-called primitive
peoples. In contrast to Herr Grosse, who believes he already knows a
world when he knows nothing more than that the Peruvian Incas were an
agricultural people, Sir Henry Maine says: "The characteristic error of
the direct observer of unfamiliar social or juridical phenomena is to
compare them too hastily with familiar phenomena apparently of the same
kind."

The connection between forms of family and "forms of production"
understood in this way is expressed in the following terms by Herr
Grosse:

>At the lowest stage, people feed themselves by means of hunting -- in
>the broadest sense of the term -- and by the gathering of plants. This
>most primitive form of production is also associated with the most
>primitive form of division of labor -- the physiologically based
>division between the two sexes. While the provision of animal food
>falls to the man, the foraging of roots and fruits is the task of the
>woman. Under these conditions, the economic center of gravity lies
>almost always on the male side, and as a consequence the primitive form
>of family everywhere bears an unmistakably patriarchal character.
>Whatever the ideas about blood relationships may be, primitive man
>stands in fact as lord and master among his wives and children, even if
>he does not recognize his progeny as blood relations. From this lowest
>stage, production can continue in two directions, according to whether
>the female or the male branch of the economy undergoes a further
>development. But which of these two branches becomes the stem depends
>above all on the natural conditions in which the primitive group lives.
>If the flora and climate of the land immediately suggest and reward the
>conservation and subsequent care of food plants, then the female branch
>of plant gathering gradually develops into plant cultivation. In fact,
>with primitive agricultural peoples this occupation is always found in
>women's hands. The economic center of gravity accordingly shifts to the
>female side, and as a result we find among all primitive societies that
>support themselves predominantly by agriculture a matriarchal family
>form or at least the traces of this. The woman stands now at the center
>of the family as the main provider and landowner. The construction of a
>matriarchy in the strict sense, however, the actual rule of women,
>occurs only in very infrequent cases -- in particular where the social
>group is not exposed to attacks by external enemies. In all other
>cases, the man regains as protector the supremacy he lost as provider.
>In this way, the family forms develop that prevail among most
>agricultural peoples, presenting a compromise between the matriarchal
>and the patriarchal direction. A large part of humanity, however, has
>undergone a completely different development. Those hunting peoples
>living in regions that place difficulties in the way of agriculture,
>while they offer animals that are suitable and profitable for
>domestication, have advanced not like the former to plant cultivation,
>but instead to that of animals. Livestock breeding, however, which
>gradually developed out of hunting, appears exactly like its
>predecessor as a privilege of the man. In this way, the economic
>superiority of the male side that is already present is strengthened,
>and this relationship finds consistent expression in the fact that all
>peoples who feed themselves principally from livestock stand under the
>rule of the patriarchal family form. Besides, the commanding position
>of the man in stock-raising societies is further increased by another
>circumstance that is similarly connected directly with the form of
>their production. Stock-raising peoples are always inclined to warlike
>entanglements and consequently to the development of a centralized
>organization for warfare. The unavoidable result is an extreme form of
>patriarchy in which woman becomes a slave without rights under a
>husband endowed with despotic power.

But those peaceful agricultural peoples among whom women rules as the
breadwinner in the family, or at least enjoys to some extent a freer
position, are generally subjugated by the warlike stock-raisers and take
over from them, along with other customs, the despotic rule of the man
in the family. "And so we find all civilized nations today under the
sign of a more or less sharply marked patriarchal family form."

The remarkable historical destinies of the human family depicted here,
in their dependence on forms of production, thus follow the schema:
hunting period -- individual family with male supremacy; stock-raising
period = individual family with still worse male supremacy; period of
lower agriculture = individual family with sporadic female supremacy,
but later subjection of agriculturalists by stock-raisers, i.e. here
individual family with male supremacy; and as the apex of the edifice,
period of higher agriculture = individual family with male supremacy.
Herr Grosse, we can see, is very serious in his rejection of modern
developmental theory. For him there is no development of family forms at
all. History begins and ends with the individual family and male
supremacy. What Grosse does not notice is that after he has showily
promised to explain the origin of family forms from forms of production,
he actually presupposes the family form as something always already
given, i.e. as the individual family, as a modern household, and assumes
this unchanged under _all_ forms of production. What he actually pursues
as different "family forms" with the change of epochs is simply the
question of the relationship of one sex to the other. Male supremacy or
female supremacy -- this is the "family form" according to Grosse, which
in a completely harmonious manner he reduces as crudely to an external
characteristic as he simplifies the "form of production" to the question
of hunting, stock-raising or agriculture. That "male supremacy" or
"female supremacy" can embrace dozens of different family forms, that
there can be different kinship systems within the same cultural stage of
"hunters" -- none of this exists for Herr Grosse, as little as does the
question of the social relations within a form of production. The
reciprocal relationship of family forms and production forms here comes
down to the following ingenious "materialism": the two sexes are seen
from the start as business competitors. Whoever feeds the family also
rules in the family, so the philistine believes, and so also does the
civil code. The bad luck of the female sex, however, is that only
exceptionally in history -- at the low stage of tillage agriculture --
were they the leading provider of food, and even then they generally had
to give way to the warlike male sex. And so the history of the family
form is basically no more than a history of women's slavery, in all
"forms of production" and despite all forms of production. The only
connection between family forms and economic forms is thus in the end
simply the slight difference between somewhat milder and somewhat
severer forms of male supremacy. In conclusion, the first message of
redemption for enslaved woman in the history of human culture appears as
the Christian church, which at least knows no distinction between the
two sexes in the blue ether of heaven, even if it still does so on
earth. "By this doctrine, Christianity endowed women with an elevated
position before which the arbitrary will of the male must bow," Herr
Grosse concludes, finally, after wandering far and wide on the waters of
economic history, dropping anchor in the harbor of the Christian church.
How "surprisingly understandable," then, those forms of family appear
that have inspired sociologists to "strange hypotheses," when they are
viewed "in connection with the forms of production"!

The most striking thing, however, about this history of the "family
form" is the treatment of the clan association or kin group, as Grosse
calls it. We have seen the tremendous role that clan associations played
in social life at earlier levels of culture. We have seen --
particularly in the wake of Morgan's epoch-making investigations -- that
they were the actual social form of people before the development of the
territorial state, and continued for a long while after to be both the
economic unit and the religious community. How do these facts stand in
the light of the remarkable history of Grosse's "family forms"? Grosse
evidently cannot simply deny the existence of a kinship constitution
among all primitive peoples. But since this contradicts his scheme of
individual families and the dominance of private property, he seeks to
reduce their significance as close to zero as he can, except for the
period of lower agriculture: "The power of kinship arose with lower
agriculture, and it decays with it as well. Among all higher
agricultural peoples, the kinship order has already either disappeared
or in the process of doing so." Grosse thus lets the "kinship power" and
its communist economy burst into the midst of economic and family
history like a pistol shot, simply to have it fall back and dissolve
right away. How the origin and existence of the kinship order and its
functions are to be explained in the millennia of cultural development
before lower agriculture, since for Grosse they had at this time neither
an economic function nor a social significance vis-à-vis the individual
family, and what these kinships were that led their shadowy existence
among hunters and stock-raisers against the background of separate
families with private housekeeping, remains a private secret for Herr
Grosse. Just as little is he concerned that his story stands in blatant
contradiction with certain generally recognized facts. Kin groups are
seen as acquiring importance only with lower agriculture; they are then
generally linked with the institution of blood revenge, with religious
observance and very frequently with animal names. All these things
however are far older than agriculture, and must therefore according to
Grosse's own theory derive from relations of production of far more
primitive cultural periods. Grosse explains the kinship order of higher
agriculturalists, such as the ancient Germans, Celts and Indians, as a
legacy from the period of lower agriculture, when they had their roots
in the female rural economy. But the higher agriculture of cultured
peoples did not arise from female tilling, but rather from stock
raising, which was already pursued by men, and where consequently,
according to Grosse, the kin groups were without significance in
relation to the patriarchal family economy. According to Grosse, the
kinship order is meaningless with these nomadic pastoralists, and only
comes to prevail for a while with settlement and agriculture. According
to the most respected scholars, however, the agrarian constitution
followed a quite opposite direction: as long as pastoralists followed a
nomadic way of life, kinship associations were the most powerful in
every respect, whereas with settlement and agriculture the kinship
constitution begins to loosen and decline in relation to the local
association of agriculturalists, whose community of interest is stronger
than the traditional blood ties, and the kinship community is
transformed into the so-called neighborhood community. This was the view
of Ludwig von Maurer, Kovalevsky, Henry Maine and [Emile] Laveleye, and
the same phenomenon has more recently been noted by [Konstantin] Kaufman
among the Kyrgyz and Yakuts of Central Asia.

We should finally mention that Grosse is understandably unable, from his
point of view, to offer the slightest explanation of the most important
phenomena in the field of primitive family relations, such as matriarchy
(mother-right), and confines himself to shrugging his shoulders and
declaring matriarchy "the rarest curiosity in sociology"; that he makes
the incredible assertion that among the Australians ideas of blood
relationship had no influence on their family systems, and the still
more incredible assertion that among the ancient Peruvians there was no
trace of kinship groups; that he bases his ideas about the agrarian
constitution of the Germanic people on Laveleye's obsolete and
unreliable material; and that finally he echoes the same Laveleye's
fabulous assertion that "still today" the Russian village community that
prevails among a population of 35 million forms a kinship community with
blood relationship, a "family community," which is about as true as it
would be to claim that all the inhabitants of Berlin formed "still
today" a great family community. All this specially enables Grosse to
treat the "church father of German Social Democracy," Morgan, as a dead
dog.

The above examination of Grosse's treatment of family forms and kinship
gives an idea of how he treats the "forms of economy." The entire proof
that he directs against the assumption of primitive communism rests on
"yes, but," with unchallengeable facts being admitted, but others
contrasted to them in such a way that what is unwanted is diminished,
what is wanted is exaggerated, and the result correspondingly dressed up
to look good.

Grosse himself reports of the lower hunters:

>Individual possession, which among all lower societies consists
>principally if not exclusively in movable goods, is here almost
>completely insignificant; the most valuable piece of property, however,
>the hunting ground, belongs to all the men of a tribe in common. It
>follows that the proceeds of hunting have to be divided from time to
>time among all members of a horde. This is reported for example among
>the Botocudos (Ehrenreich, "Über die Botocudos," in _Zeitschrift für
>Ethnologie_, XIX, 311). In some parts of Australia, similar customs
>exist. Thus all members of a primitive group are and remain more or
>less equally poor. Since there are no essential differences of wealth,
>a main source for the origin of tribal differences is lacking. In
>general, all adult men have equal rights within the tribe.

In the same way, "membership of a kin group has in some (!) connections
a fundamental influence on the life of the lower hunter. It ascribes him
the right to use a particular hunting ground, and it gives him the right
and duty of protection and revenge" (this page). Similarly, Grosse
concedes the possibility of a kinship communism among the lower hunters
of central California.

But for all that, the kinship group here is loose and weak, there is no
economic community. "The mode of production of the Arctic hunters
however is so completely individualist that the kinship connection is
scarcely able to resist centrifugal tendencies." Likewise, among the
Australians, the use of the common hunting land "in hunting and
gathering is generally pursued not at all in common, but each individual
family conducts a separate economy." And in general, "the lack of food
does not permit lasting unification of large groups, but forces them to
disperse" (this page).

Let us turn then to the higher hunters.

_It is true that_ "land among the higher hunters is indeed as a rule the
common property of the tribe or kinship group" (this page), true that we
directly find at this stage large buildings as common quarters for such
groups (this page), while we also learn: "The extensive dams and
defenses that [Alexander] Mackenzie saw in the rivers of the Haidah and
that in his estimation must have required the work of the whole tribe,
were supervised by the local chief, without whose permission no one was
allowed to fish. They were thus very likely seen as the property of the
whole village community, to which the fishing waters and hunting grounds
undividedly belonged" (this page).

_But_ "movable property here has acquired such an extension and
importance that despite the equal possession of land a great inequality
of wealth can develop" (this page), and "as a rule, food, so far as we
can see, is no more seen as common property than are other movable
goods. Thus the domestic kinship groups can only to a very limited sense
be described as economic communities" (this page).

We move then to the next higher cultural stage, that of nomadic
stock-raising (pastoralism). Here again Grosse tells us:

>_It is true that_ "even the most restless nomads do not roam in
>unbounded spaces, they all rather move within a quite firmly limited
>region, which is seen as the property of their tribe and which is
>frequently divided again among the individual separate families and kin
>groups". Furthermore: "The land in almost the whole region of
>stock-raising is the common property of the tribe or kin group". "The
>land is naturally the common property of all kin group members and as
>such is divided by the kin group or its chief between the different
>families for their use".

_But_ "the land is not the most valuable possession of the nomad. His
greatest wealth is his herd, and livestock is always (!) the separate
property of the individual families. The stock-raising kin group has
never (!) developed into a community of economy and possession."

Finally we have the lower agriculturalists. Here, it is true for the
first time that the kinship group is admitted to be a completely
communist economic community.

_But_ -- and here this "but" follows hard on the heels -- here too
"industry undermines social equality" (when Grosse talks of industry he
naturally means commodity production, being unable to differentiate the
one from the other), "creating a movable individual property, which
prevails over the common property in land and destroys this.'" And
despite the community of land, "the separation between rich and poor
already exists here." Communism is thus reduced to a brief interval of
economic history, which moreover begins with private property and ends
with private property. _Quod erat demonstrandum_.

### 2.3

In order to assess the value of Grosse's schema, we shall turn directly
to the facts. Let us examine the economic form of the most backward
peoples -- if only with a fleeting glance. Who are these?

Grosse calls them the "lower hunters," and says of them:

>The lower hunting peoples today form only a small fragment of humanity.
>Their imperfect and unfruitful form of production condemns them to
>numerical weakness and cultural poverty, and they are everywhere on the
>retreat in the face of larger and stronger peoples, now continuing
>their existence in inaccessible primal forests and inhospitable
>deserts. A large part of these wretched tribes belong to pygmy races.
>It is precisely the weakest peoples who are forced by the stronger in
>the struggle for existence into the regions most hostile to culture,
>and thereby condemned also to cultural stagnation. Yet representatives
>of the oldest economic form are still found today on all continents
>with the exception of Europe. Africa houses many such hunting peoples
>who have grown small; unfortunately, however, we so far have
>information only on one of these, the Bushmen of the Kalahari desert
>[in German South-West Africa -- R.L.]; the lives of the other pygmy
>tribes are still hidden in the darkness of the central African forests.
>If we turn from Africa to the East, we find first of all in central
>Ceylon [off the southern tip of the Indian peninsula -- R.L.] the dwarf
>hunting people of the Vedda, then on the Andaman islands the Mincopie,
>in inland Sumatra the Kubu and in the mountain wildernesses of the
>Philippines the Aeta -- three tribes who again belong to the small
>races. The whole of the Australian continent was peopled with lower
>hunting peoples before the European settlement; and if in the last half
>of this century the indigenous peoples have been driven out of the
>greater part of the coastal regions by the colonists, they still
>persist in the deserts of the hinterland. In America, finally, from the
>extreme south to the far north, we find a whole series of groups of an
>extreme cultural poverty. In the rain- and storm-lashed mountain wastes
>around Cape Horn [the southern tip of South America -- R.L.] dwell the
>inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, whom more than one observer has
>declared to be the poorest and crudest of all humans. Besides the
>Botocudos with their evil reputation, many other hunting tribes still
>wander through the forests of Brazil, including the Bororó who are
>somewhat familiar to us thanks to the studies of [Karl] von den
>Steinen. Central California [on the west coast of North America --
>R.L.] has a number of tribes at a level only little above the most
>wretched peoples of Australia.

Without continuing any further with Grosse, who strangely also counts
the Eskimos among the lowest peoples, we shall now dwell on some of the
tribes mentioned above in search of traces of a socially planned
organization of labor.

Let us turn first of all to the Australian cannibals, who according to
several scholars exist at the lowest level of culture that the human
race displays on this earth. Among these aborigines we particularly find
the already mentioned primitive division of labor between men and women;
the latter principally see to vegetable food as well as wood and water,
while the men are responsible for hunting and providing animal food.

We also find here a picture of social labor that is the direct opposite
of the "individual search for food" and offers an example right away of
how the most primitive societies see to it that all labor-power needed
is diligently applied, for example:

>All the males in the Chepara tribe are expected to provide food, if not
>sick. If a man is lazy and stays in the camp, he is jeered at and
>insulted by the others. Men, women, and children leave the camp early
>in the morning for the purpose of hunting for food where they think
>that game will be plentiful. The men and women carry the various
>catches to the nearest water hole, where fires are made and game is
>cooked. The men, women, and children all eat together amicably, the
>food being distributed among them by the old men equally to all the
>men, women, and children. After the meal, the women carry what is left
>of the cooked food to the camp, men hunting by the way.

Now some further information on how production is planned among the
Australian aborigines. This is in fact extremely complicated, and worked
out in the utmost detail. Each Australian tribe is divided into a number
of groups, each one being named after an animal or a plant that it
honors, and possessing a demarcated part of the tribe's total territory.
One particular territory thus belongs for example to the kangaroo-men,
another to the emu-men (the emu is a large bird similar to an ostrich),
a third to the snake-men (the Australians even eat snakes), etc.
According to the findings of the most recent scientific research, these
"totems," as we have already mentioned in another connection, are almost
always animals and plants that the aborigines make use of as food. Each
of these groups has its chief, who takes the lead in the hunt. The
animal or plant name and the cult corresponding to it are not an empty
form: each particular group of aborigines is in fact obliged to provide
the animal or plant food of its name, and to take responsibility for the
supply and continuation of this source of food. And each of these groups
does this not for itself, but above all for the _other_ groups in the
tribe. The kangaroo-men, for example, are obliged to provide kangaroo
meat for the rest of the tribe, the snake-men to provide snakes, the
caterpillar-men a certain caterpillar that is seen as a delicacy, and so
on. All this is bound up with strict religious observances and great
ceremonies. It is almost a universal rule, for example, that the people
of a particular group may not eat their own animal or plant totem, or
only in great moderation, although they must provide this for others. A
man in the snake-group, for example, if he kills a snake -- even in
times of great hunger -- must refrain from eating it himself, but rather
bring it back to the camp for the others. In the same way, an emu-man
will only consume emu meat with extreme moderation, and never take the
eggs and fat of the bird -- which are used as a remedy -- for himself,
but hand them over to his fellow tribes people. On the other hand, other
groups may not hunt or gather and consume the animal or plant without
the permission of the corresponding totem men. Each year, a festive
ceremony is held by each group, with the object of securing the
multiplication of the totemic animal or plant (by way of singing, wind
instruments and various religious ceremonies), with only the other
groups being allowed to eat it. The time for such ceremonies to take
place is decided for each group by its chief, who is also in charge of
the ceremony. And this time is directly bound up with the conditions of
production. In central Australia, animals and plants suffer from a long
dry season, while the short wet season leads to an increase in animal
life and a vigorous plant growth. Most of the ceremonies of the totem
groups are then held as the good season approaches. According to
[Friedrich] Ratzel, it is a "comic misunderstanding" to say that the
aborigines call themselves after their most important foodstuffs. In the
system of totem groups briefly indicated above, however, anyone can
already recognize at first glance an elaborate organization of social
production. The individual totem groups are evidently just limbs in an
extensive system of division of labor. All the groups together form an
ordered and planned whole, and each group also conducts itself in a
quite ordered and planned way under a unitary leadership. And the fact
that this system of production assumes a religious form, the form of
various food taboos, ceremonies, etc., merely shows that this production
form is of _age-old date_, that this organization has existed among the
aborigines for many centuries or even millennia, so that it has had time
to ossify into rigid formulas, and what originally were mere
expediencies for the purpose of producing and providing food have become
articles of a belief in secret connections. These connections,
discovered by the Englishmen [Walter Baldwin] Spencer and [Francis
James] Gillen, are also confirmed by another scholar, [James George]
Frazer, who expressly says, for example:

>We have to bear in mind that the various totemic groups in totemic
>society do not live in isolation from one another; they intermingle and
>practice their magic powers for the common good. In the original
>system, if we are not mistaken, the kangaroo-men hunted and killed
>kangaroo for the benefit of all other totemic groups as well as their
>own, and it would have been the same with the caterpillar totem, the
>hawk totem and the rest. Under the new system [i.e. in the religious
>form -- R.L.], in which a totemic group was forbidden to kill and eat
>its own totem, the kangaroo-men continued to provide kangaroos, but no
>longer for their own consumption; the emu-men continued to see to the
>multiplication of emus, although they were no longer allowed to enjoy
>emu meat; the caterpillar-men continued their magic arts for the
>procreation of caterpillars, even if these delicacies were now destined
>for other stomachs.

In sum, what appears to us today as a religious system was in age-old
times a simple system of organized social production with a far-reaching
division of labor.

If we now turn to the distribution of products among the Australian
aborigines, we find an even more detailed and complex system. Each part
of a wild animal killed, each bird egg found and each handful of fruit
gathered, is carefully allocated according to quite firm rules to
particular members of the society for their consumption. For example,
what the women gather in the way of plant food belongs to them and their
children. The proceeds of the men's hunting is divided according to
rules that differ from tribe to tribe, but which in all tribes are
extremely detailed. The English scholar [Alfred William] Howitt, for
example, who studied the populations in southeastern Australia, chiefly
in the state of Victoria, found the following kind of distribution:

>It is assumed that a man kills a kangaroo at a distance from the camp.
>Two other men are with him but are too late to assist in killing it.
>The distance from the camp being considerable, the kangaroo is cooked
>before being carried home. While the first man lights a fire, the
>others cut up the game. The three cook the entrails and eat them. The
>following distribution is made. Men 2 and 3 receive one leg and the
>tail, and one leg and part of the haunch, because they were present,
>and had helped to cut the game up. Man number 1 received the remainder
>that he carried to the camp. The head and back are taken by his wife to
>her parents, the remainder goes to his parents. If he is short of meat,
>he keeps a little, but if, for instance, he has an opossum, he gives it
>all away. His mother, if she has caught some fish, may give him some,
>or his wife's parents may give _him some of their share_; and they also
>would in such a case give her some next morning. _Children in all cases
>well cared for by their grandparents_.

The following rules prevail in one tribe. With a kangaroo, for example,
the hunter takes a piece near the loin, the father receives the
backbone, ribs, shoulder and head; the mother the right leg and the
younger brother the left foreleg. The father gives the tail and another
piece of the back to his parents, the mother gives a part of the thigh
and the shin to her parents. With a koala, the hunter keeps the left
ribs for himself, the father receives the right hind-leg and mother the
left, the elder brother receives the right foreleg and the younger
brother the left. The elder sister receives a piece along the backbone,
the younger one the liver. The right rib portion belongs to the father's
brother, a side piece to the maternal uncle, and the head goes to the
young men's camp.

In another tribe, however, the food obtained is always divided equally
among those present. If a wallaby (a smaller species of kangaroo) is
killed, and there are ten or twelve people, each of them receives a part
of the animal. None of them touches the animal or any part of it until
they have been given their portion by the hunter. If the person who
killed the animal happens not to be present while it is being cooked, no
one touches it until he returns. The women receive equal portions to the
men, and children are carefully seen to by both parents.

These various modes of distribution, which differ from one tribe to
another, also reveal their age-old character by the way that they appear
in ritual forms and are summed up in sayings. This expresses a tradition
that may go back several millennia, and is seen by each generation as an
unbreakable and strictly maintained rule that has been handed down. But
two particular features of this system stand out very clearly. Above
all, among the Australian aborigines -- perhaps those humans who have
remained most backward -- it is not only production but also consumption
that is planned and organized as a common social affair; and secondly,
this plan evidently aims at the provisioning and security of all members
of society, according both to their needs in terms of food and to their
productive power. Under all conditions, special care is taken of old
people, who in turn care look after the small children along with the
mothers. The entire economic life of the Australian aborigines --
production, division of labor, distribution of foodstuffs -- has thus
been planned and organized in the strictest way from earliest times by
way of firm rules.

From Australia we turn to North America. Here in the West, the sparse
remnants of Indians living on the Isla del Tiburón in the Gulf of
California and a narrow strip of the adjacent mainland present a
particular interest, thanks to their complete isolation and their
hostility to outsiders, which is how they have preserved their age-old
customs in a very pure state. In 1895, United States scientists
undertook an expedition to study this tribe, and the results of this
were described by the American [William John] McGee. According to his
report, the Seri Indian tribe -- the name of this now very sparse people
-- is divided into four groups, each of these being named after an
animal. The two largest are the pelican group and the turtle group. The
customs, practices and rules of these groups in relation to their
totemic animals are kept strictly secret, and were very hard to
ascertain. But if we learn right away that the diet of these Indians
consists principally of the meat of pelicans, turtles, fish and other
sea creatures, and bear in mind the previously described system of
totemic groups among the Australian aborigines, we may assume with a
high degree of certainty that also among these Indians off the
Californian coast the secret cult of totemic animals and the division of
the tribe into corresponding groups expresses nothing other than the
survivals of an age-old, strictly organized system of production with a
division of labor, that has ossified into religious symbols. This view
is reinforced, for example, by the fact that the supreme protective
spirit of the Seri Indians is the pelican, but it is also this bird that
forms the basis of that tribe's economic existence. Pelican meat is the
main food, pelican skins are used as clothing and bedding, as shields,
and as the most important articles of exchange with outsiders. The
Seri's most important form of labor, hunting, is still practiced
according to strict rules. Hunting pelicans, for example, is a
well-organized common undertaking "with at least a semi-ceremonial
character." Pelican hunts may take place only at particular times, in
such a way that the birds are protected during their breeding season, so
as to secure their progeny. "The butchery [the massive slaughter of
these top-heavy birds presents no difficulties -- R.L.] is followed by a
gluttonous feast, in which the half-famished families gorge the tenderer
parts in the darkness, and noisily carouse in the carnage until overcome
by slumber. Next day the matrons select the carcasses of least injured
plumage and carefully remove the skins." The feast lasts for several
days, with various ceremonies being associated with it. This "gluttonous
feast," therefore, and the noisy "gorging in darkness," which Professor
Bücher would certainly note as a sign of purely animal behavior, is
actually very well organized -- its ceremonial character is sufficient
proof of this. The planned character of the hunt is combined with strict
regulation of distribution and consumption. The common eating and
drinking proceeds in a definite sequence: first comes the chief (who is
also leader of the hunt), then the other warriors in order of age, then
the oldest woman followed by her daughters in order of age, and finally
the children also by order of age, with the girls, particularly those
approaching marriageable age, enjoying certain preference by the
connivance of the women:

>[E]very member of the family or clan is entitled to necessary food and
>raiment, and it is the duty of every other person to see that the need
>is supplied. The stress of this duty is graded partly by proximity (so
>that, other things equal, it begins with the nearest person), but
>chiefly by standing and responsibility in the group (which again are
>reckoned as equivalents of age), whereby it becomes the business of the
>first at the feast to see that enough is left over to supply all below
>him; and this duty passes down the line in such wise as to protect the
>interests of the helpless infant ...

From South America, we have the testimony of Professor [Karl] von den
Steinen about the wild Indian tribe of the Bororó in Brazil. Here again
we have above all the typical division of labor. The women obtain plant
food, look for roots with a pointed stick, climb with great agility up
palm trees, collecting nuts and cutting the palm kernels, seeking fruits
and the like. The women also prepare plant food, and manufacture the
cooking pots. When the women return home, they give the men fruit, etc.
and receive whatever meat is left over. Distribution and consumption are
strictly regulated. According to von den Steinen:

>If Bororó etiquette in no way prevents them from sharing their meals,
>they have other strange customs for this, which clearly show that
>tribes where the proceeds of hunting are scarce have to search somehow
>for ways to forestall quarrels and disputes. One rule here is
>particularly striking: _no one cooks the game that he has shot himself,
>but gives it to someone else to cook_! The same prudent foresight is
>practiced for valuable hides and teeth. If a jaguar is killed, a great
>feast is held and the meat is eaten. But _it is not the hunter_ who
>receives the hide and the teeth, but rather ... the closest relative of
>the tribesman or woman who most recently died. The hunter is honored,
>and is presented by everyone with macaw feathers [the Bororós' most
>prized ornament -- R.L.] and bows decorated by oassú ribbons. The most
>important measure to preserve peace, however, is bound up with the
>office of _medicine man_,

or, as European like to say in such cases, the magician or priest. This
person must be in attendance at the killing of any animal, but it is
particularly important that every animal killed, as well as plant food,
is only distributed and consumed by way of particular ceremonies.
Hunting takes place on the initiative and under the leadership of the
chief. The young and unmarried men live together in the "men's house,"
where they work together, produce weapons, tools and ornaments, spin,
hold wrestling matches and also eat together, in strict discipline and
order, as we have already mentioned above. "A family one of whose
members dies," says von den Steinen, "suffers a great loss

>For everything that the dead person used is burned, thrown into the
>river or placed in the bone-basket, so that he will have no occasion to
>return. The hut is then completely evacuated. But the bereaved are
>given presents, bows and arrows are made for them, and there is also
>the custom that, if a jaguar is killed, the hide is given "_to the
>brother of the last woman who died or to the uncle of the last man who
>died_."

A fully worked-out plan and social organization thus prevails in both
production and distribution.

If we pass through the American mainland down to the most southerly
point, we find here a primitive people at the lowest level of culture,
the Fuegians, who inhabit the inhospitable archipelago at the tip of
South America, the first information on them being brought back to
Europe in the seventeenth century. In 1698, the French government sent
an expedition to the southern ocean, in response to French pirates who
had been plying their trade there for many years. One of the engineers
on board kept a diary that has survived, and contains the following
summary information about the Fuegians:

>Each family, that is, father and mother, along with those children not
>yet married, has its pirogue (a canoe made of tree bark), in which they
>carry everything they need. They sleep at night wherever they find
>themselves. If there is no ready-made hut, then they build one ... They
>make a small fire in the middle, around which they lie together on
>grass. When they feel hungry, they cook shellfish, which the eldest man
>among them distributes in equal portions. The main occupation of the
>men, indeed their duty, consists in building huts, hunting and fishing;
>looking after the canoes and gathering shellfish falls to the women ...
>They hunt for whales in the following manner: Five or six canoes put
>out to sea together, and when they find a whale they pursue it and
>harpoon it with large arrows whose points made of bone or stone are
>very skillfully cut ... When they kill an animal or a bird, or catch
>the fish and shellfish that are their regular food, they divide these
>among all the families, since they are ahead of us in possessing almost
>all their combined means of subsistence in common.

From America we turn to Asia. Here we are told the following about the
pygmy tribes of the Mincopie on the Andaman archipelago (in the Gulf of
Bengal) by the English researcher E[dward] H[orace] Man, who spent
twelve years among them and obtained a more exact knowledge of them than
any other European.

The Mincopie are divided into nine tribes, each consisting of a
considerable number of small groups of between thirty and fifty
individuals, though sometimes as many as 300. Each of these groups has
its leader, and the whole tribe has a chief who stands above those of
the individual communities. Yet his authority is very limited; it
consists principally in holding assemblies of all the communities that
belong to his tribe. He is the leader in hunting and fishing and on
migrations, and he also settles disputes. Work within each community is
done in common, with a division of labor between men and women. Hunting,
fishing, obtaining honey, constructing canoes, bows and arrows and other
tools falls to the men, while the women bring in wood and water as well
as planting food, producing ornaments and cooking. It is the duty of all
men and women who stay at home to care for children, the sick and the
aged, and to keep the fires going in the various huts; each person
capable of work is obliged to work for themselves and the community, and
it is also the custom to make sure that there is always a reserve of
food to provide for any strangers who may arrive. Small children, the
weak and the aged are the special object of general attention, and they
have an even better deal in terms of the satisfaction of their daily
needs than do the other members of the society.

The consumption of food is governed by definite rules. A married man may
only eat together with other married men or bachelors, never with other
women or with his own household, unless he is already of a prescribed
age. Unmarried people take their meals separately -- male youths in one
place, girls in another.

The preparation of meals is the customary duty of the women, who see to
this while the men are away. But if they are particularly occupied with
obtaining wood and water, as on feast days or after a particularly
successful hunt, then one of the men does the cooking, and when this is
half finished, divides it among those present and leaves the further
preparation to them, which they do on their own hearths. If the chief is
present, he receives the first and indeed the lion's share, then come
the men and after them the women and children in succession; what
remains belongs to the distributor.

In the manufacture of weapons, tools and other articles, the Mincopie
generally spend a remarkable time and great diligence, being able to
spend hours on end laboriously working a piece of iron with a stone
hammer in order to form a spear or arrowhead, to improve the shape of a
bow, etc. They devote themselves to these tasks even when no immediate
or foreseeable necessity drives them to such efforts. They cannot be
accused of greed -- it is said of them -- as they often present (a
misunderstood European expression for "distribute") the best that they
possess, and preserve for their own use objects that are in no way
better worked, still less making better ones for themselves.

We conclude this series of examples with a sample from the life of the
primitive peoples of Africa. Here, the pygmy Bushmen of the Kalahari
desert are frequently taken as an example of extreme backwardness and
the lowest stage of human culture. German, English and French
researchers agree in saying that the Bushmen live in groups (hordes),
conducting their economic life in common. Their small bands are marked
by complete equality, in respect of means of subsistence, weapons, etc.
The foodstuffs that they find on their travels are collected in sacks
that are emptied out in the camp. As the German scholar [Siegfried]
Passarge reports: "The day's harvest then makes its appearance: roots,
tubers, fruits, grubs, rhinoceros birds, bullfrogs, turtles,
grasshoppers, even snakes and iguanas." The booty is then divided among
all.

>The systematic gathering of vegetables, for example fruits, roots,
>tubers, etc., as well as smaller animals, is the business of women.
>They have to supply the horde with supplies of this kind, and the
>children help with this. Men will occasionally also bring back
>something that they accidentally happen upon, though for them gathering
>is only a secondary matter. The main task of men is hunting.

The proceeds of the hunt are consumed by the horde in common. Space and
food are provided around the common fire for traveling Bushmen from
allied hordes. Passarge, as a good European with the intellectual
spectacles of bourgeois society, immediately remarks on the "exaggerated
virtue" with which the Bushmen share the last morsel with others -- this
being a token of their cultural incapability!

It is apparent, then, that the most primitive peoples, and particularly
those far removed from settled existence and agriculture, who stand in a
sense at the starting point of the chain of economic development as far
as this is known to us from direct observation, offer a quite different
picture of relations than we see in Herr Grosse's schema. What we have
on all sides is not "dispersed" and "separate" household economies, but
rather strictly regulated economic communities with typical features of
communist organization. This is a question of the "lower hunters." As
for the "higher hunters," the picture of the kinship economy of the
Iroquois, as described for us in detail by Morgan, is quite sufficient.
But stock-raisers, too, provide sufficient material to give the lie to
Grosse's bold contentions.

The agricultural mark community, accordingly, is not the only primitive
communist organization that we find in economic history, but rather the
most developed one, not the first but the last. It is not a product of
agriculture, but rather of the immeasurably long earlier traditions of
communism which, born in the womb of the gens organization, was finally
applied to agriculture, where it precisely reached an apogee that
heralded its own decline. In no way therefore do the facts confirm
Grosse's schema. If we then ask for an explanation of the remarkable
phenomenon of a communism that emerges in the midst of economic history
only to immediately disappear again, Herr Grosse offers us, with one of
his clever "materialist" explanations:

>We have seen in fact that among the lower agriculturalists, the kin
>group has particularly acquired so much more force and power than among
>the peoples of other cultural forms, because it appears here initially
>as a community of dwelling, possession and economy. But the fact that
>it has taken such a form here is explained in turn by the nature of the
>lower agricultural economy, which unites people, whereas hunting and
>stock-raising disperse them.

Spatial "uniting" or "dispersal" of people in work thus decides whether
communism or private property are to prevail. It is a pity that Herr
Grosse has forgotten to enlighten us why woods and meadows, in which
people are most likely to live "dispersed," precisely remain common
property for longest -- in some places down to the present day --
whereas the agricultural land on which people "unite" was the earliest
to transfer to private ownership. And further, why the form of
production that "unites" people more than any other in the whole of
economic history, i.e. modern large-scale industry, far from generating
any kind of common property, has produced the strictest form of private
property, i.e. capitalist property.

We see then that Grosse's "materialism" is one more proof that it is not
enough to talk about "production" and its importance for the whole of
social life in order to conceive history from a materialist perspective,
and that separated from its other aspect, from its revolutionary idea of
development, historical materialism becomes a crude and ungainly wooden
crutch, instead of, as with Marx, a stroke of genius of the scientific
spirit.

But what this shows above all else is that Herr Grosse, who talks so
much about production and its forms, is unclear about the most
fundamental concepts of relations of production. We have already seen
how what he understands right away by forms of production is such purely
external categories as hunting, stock raising and agriculture. But in
terms of answering the question as to the form of property within each
of these "forms of production" -- that is, the question whether there is
common property, family ownership or private ownership, and to whom such
property belongs -- Grosse merely distinguishes between categories such
as "landownership" on the one hand and "moveable possessions" on the
other. If he finds that these belong to different owners, he then asks
which is "more important": the "moveable" possessions on the one hand,
or immoveable landed property on the other. And whichever appears "more
important" to Herr Grosse, he takes as decisive for the form of property
in this particular society. He decides, for example, that among higher
hunters, "moveable possessions have already acquired such an importance"
that they are more weighty than landed property; and since moveable
possessions such as foodstuffs are private property, Grosse does not
recognize any communistic economy here, despite the self-evidence of
common property in land.

But distinctions of this kind made according to purely external
characteristics -- such as those of moveable versus immoveable
possessions -- do not have the slightest significance for production,
and are more or less on the same level as Grosse's other distinctions --
in family forms between male supremacy and female supremacy, or in forms
of production between dispersed and uniting activities. "Moveable
possessions," for example, may consist of foodstuffs or raw materials,
ornaments and cult objects, or tools. They may be produced for a
society's own use or for exchange. Depending on this, they will have a
very different significance for relations of production. In general,
Grosse judges the production and property relations of different peoples
-- and he is here a typical representative of present-day bourgeois
society -- according to foodstuffs and other objects of consumption in
the broadest sense. If he finds that such objects of consumption are
possessed and used by individuals, this demonstrates for him the rule of
"individual property" among the people in question. This is the typical
manner in which primitive communism is "scientifically" refuted today.
According to this profound point of view, a community of beggars which
collects and consumes its scanty takings in common, such as is very
common in the East, or a band of thieves who enjoy their stolen goods
together, are pure examples of a "communistic economic society." A mark
community, on the other hand, which possesses its land in common and
works it together, but in which the fruits are consumed on a family
basis -- each family from its piece of land -- is called "an economic
community only in a very limited sense." In short, what is decisive for
the character of production from this point of view is the right of
ownership over means of consumption and not over means of production,
i.e. the conditions of distribution and not those of production. We have
reached here a key point in conceptions of political economy, which is
fundamentally important for the understanding of all economic history.
But we shall now leave Herr Grosse to his fate, and turn our attention
to this question in a more general fashion.

### 2.4

Anyone who embarks on the study of economic history, and wants to
discover the various forms that the economic relations of society have
presented in their historical development, must first of all be clear as
to what feature of economic relations is to be taken as the touchstone
and measure of this development. In order to find one's way among the
wealth of phenomena on any particular terrain, and particularly their
historical succession, complete clarity is required as to what element
it is that is as it were the inner axis around which the phenomena
revolve. The particular element that Morgan, for example, took as the
measure of cultural history and touchstone of its present level, was the
development of productive technology. In this way he did indeed grasp
and reveal the root of the whole cultural existence of humanity. For our
purposes here, however, those of economic history, Morgan's measure is
not sufficient. The technology of human labor precisely shows the stage
that humans have reached in the mastery of external nature. Each new
step in the perfection of productive technology is at the same time a
step in the subjugation of physical nature by the human mind, and
thereby a step in the development of human culture in general. But if we
particularly want to investigate the forms of production in society, the
relationship of people to nature is not enough; what we are interested
in here is first and foremost a different aspect of human labor, i.e.
the relations in which people stand _to one another_ in work; what
interests us is not the technology of production but its social
organization. For the cultural level of a primitive people it is very
important to know that they are familiar with the potter's wheel and
practice pottery. Morgan takes this important advance in technology as
the marker of an entire cultural period, which he describes as the
transition from savagery to barbarism. But on the basis of this fact we
can still judge very little about the form of production of this people.
For this we would first have to discover a whole series of conditions,
for example who practices pottery in this society, whether all members
of the society or only some of them, for example that it is women who
supply the community with pots, whether the products of pottery are
destined only for the community's -- perhaps a village's -- own use, or
rather serve for exchange with others, whether the products of each
person who practices pottery are used only by themselves, or whether
everything manufactured serves all members of the community in common.
We see that there are ramified social connections in a position to
determine the character of the form of production in a society: the
division of labor, the distribution of products among consumers,
exchange. But all these aspects of economic life are themselves
determined by one decisive factor, production. The fact that the
distribution of products and exchange can only be consequent phenomena
is apparent at first glance. So that products can be distributed among
consumers, or exchanged, they must first of all be manufactured.
Production itself is therefore the first and most important element in a
society's economic life. In the process of production, however, what is
decisive is the relations in which those who work stand to their means
of production. All work requires particular raw materials, a particular
workplace, and then -- particular tools. We already know what a high
importance the tools of labor and their manufacture assume in the life
of human society. Human labor-power intervenes to perform work with
these tools and other dead means of production, and to produce the means
of consumption, in the broadest sense, that are needed for social life.
The relation of those who work to their means of production is the first
question of production and its decisive factor. And by this we do not
mean the _technical_ relation, not the greater or lesser perfection of
the means of production with which people work, nor the way in which
they proceed with their work. We mean rather the _social_ relation
between human labor-power and the dead means of production, i.e. the
question as _to whom the means of production belong_. In the course of
time, this relationship has changed many times. Each time, however, the
whole character of production has changed along with this -- the pattern
of the division of labor, the distribution of products, the direction
and scale of exchange, and finally the whole material and intellectual
life of society. According to whether those who work possess their means
of production in common, or individuals each work for themselves, or do
not possess anything but are rather along with the means of production
themselves the property of non-workers as means of production, or are
chained unfree to the means of production, or as free people who possess
no means of production are forced to sell their labor-power as a means
of production -- we accordingly have either a communist form of
production, or a small peasant and handicraft one, or a slave economy,
or a feudal economy based on serfdom, or finally a capitalist economy
with the wage system. And each of these economic forms has its
particular type of division of labor, distribution of products and
exchange, as well as its own social, political and intellectual life. It
is enough in human economic history for the relationship between those
who work and the means of production to radically change, for all other
aspects of social, political and intellectual life to change radically
as well, so that a whole new society emerges. Of course, there is a
continuing interaction between all these aspects of a society's economic
life. Not only does the relationship of labor-power to the means of
production influence the division of labor, the distribution of products
and exchange, but all of these react in turn on the relation of
production. But this kind of action is different. The prevailing kind of
division of labor, distribution of wealth and particularly exchange at a
given economic stage may gradually undermine the relation between
labor-power and the means of production from which they themselves
arose. Their form however is only altered if the relation between
labor-power and means of production has become obsolete and a radical
transformation takes place, a literal revolution. Thus the respective
transformations that occur in the relation between labor-power and means
of production form the visible great milestones on the road of economic
history, they mark out the natural epochs in the economic development of
human society.

How important it is for the understanding of economic history to be
clear about what is essential in this history is shown by examining the
partition of economic history that is most current and most celebrated
in German political economy today. We refer to that of Professor Bücher.
In his _Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft_ [The Rise of the National
Economy], Bücher explains how important a correct partition of economic
history into epochs is for its understanding. In pursuit of this task,
however, he does not just tackle the question and show us the result of
his rational investigations, but rather prepares us first for a proper
evaluation of his own work, by holding forth with great complacency on
the inadequacy of all his predecessors.

"The first question," he says,

>that the political economist has to raise, if he wants to understand
>the economy of a people in a remote epoch, will be "Is this economy a
>_national_ economy? Are its phenomena of the same nature as those of
>our present-day exchange economy, or are the two different in nature?"

>We cannot spare the more recent "historical" school the reproach that,

>epochs, for better or worse ... Nowhere can this be more clearly seen
>than in the way that the distinctive features of the present economic

What partitioning of economic history then does Professor Bücher
propose? Let us hear.

>
>3: The stage of national economy (commodity production, stage of

>through a series of economic units before they are consumed.

This schema of economic history is interesting first of all for what it
does _not_ contain. For Professor Bücher, economic history begins with
the mark community of European civilized peoples, thus already with
higher agriculture. The whole millennial period of primitive relations
of production that preceded higher agriculture, relations in which
countless populations still find themselves today, Bücher characterizes,
as we know, as "non-economy," the period of his famous "individual
search for food," and "non-labor." For Bücher, economic history starts
with the final form of primitive communism, in which, with fixed
settlement and higher agriculture, the beginnings of the unavoidable
break-up and transition to inequality, exploitation and class society
are already present. If Grosse contests communism for the whole
developmental period prior to the agricultural mark community, Bücher
simply strikes this period out of economic history.

The second stage of "self-contained urban economy" is another
epoch-making discovery that we owe to the "insight of genius" of the
Leipzig professor, as Schurze would say. If the "self-contained domestic
economy," for example that of a mark community, was characterized by the
fact that it embraced a circle of individuals who satisfied all their
economic needs within this domestic economy, then in the medieval town
of Western and Central Europe -- as it is only this that Bücher
understands by his "urban economy" -- the very opposite was the case. In
the medieval town there was no common "economy" of any kind, but rather
-- to adopt Professor Bücher's jargon -- as many "economies" as there
were workshops and households of guild artisans, each of whom produced,
sold and consumed for himself -- even if under general guild and town
rules. But even taken as a whole, the medieval guild town of Germany or
France was no "self-contained" economic zone, as its existence was
precisely based on reciprocal exchange with the countryside around, from
which it drew foodstuffs and raw materials, and for which it
manufactured handicraft products. Bücher constructs around each town a
self-contained orbit of countryside that he encloses in his "urban
economy," by conveniently reducing exchange between town and country
simply to exchange with _peasants_ in the immediate surroundings. And
yet the manors of rich feudal lords, who were the best customers for
urban trade and who had their seats partly scattered across the
countryside far from town, partly within the town -- particularly in the
imperial and episcopal cities -- here, however, forming a distinct
economic zone, Bücher leaves entirely out of account, just as he
completely ignores foreign trade, which was extremely important for
medieval economic relations and particularly for the long-term destiny
of cities. As for what was really characteristic of the medieval cities,
however, that they were centers of _commodity production_, which became
here for the first time the prevailing form of production, even if on a
limited territory, Professor Bücher ignores it. Conversely, for him,
commodity production only begins with the "national economy" -- as we
well know, bourgeois political economy likes to describe the present-day
capitalist economic system with this fiction, i.e. as a "stage" in
economic life, whereas what is characteristic is precisely that it is
not just commodity production, but _capitalist_ production. Grosse calls
commodity production simply "industry," in order to show the superiority
of a professor of economics over a mere sociologist.

But let us turn from these side issues to the main question. Professor
Bücher presents the "self-contained domestic economy" as the first
"stage" of his economic history. What does he understand by this
expression? We have already mentioned that this stage begins with the
agricultural village community. But besides the primitive mark
community, Professor Bücher also counts other historical forms as
belonging to the stage of "self-contained domestic economy," in
particular the antique slave economy of the Greeks and Romans, and the
medieval feudal manor. The entire economic history of civilized
humanity, from its grey dawn through classical antiquity and the whole
of the Middle Ages down to the threshold of modern times, is brought
together as a single "stage" of production, to which is opposed the
medieval European guild town as the second stage, and the present-day
capitalist economy as the third stage. Professor Bücher thus classes the
communist village community leading its calm existence somewhere in the
mountain valleys of the Punjab, the household of Pericles in the heyday
of Athenian civilization, and the feudal court of the bishop of Bamberg
in the Middle Ages, as one and the same "economic stage." But any child
with even a superficial knowledge of history from school textbooks will
understand that relations that are basically different are being
squeezed here into a single category. On the one hand we have in the
communistic agricultural communities a general equality of the mass of
peasants in possession and law, no class differences or at most very
embryonic, while on the other hand, in ancient Greece or Rome as well as
in feudal medieval Europe, we have the most glaring development of
social classes -- freemen and slaves, lords and serfs, the privileged
and those with no rights, wealth and poverty or misery. On the one hand
the general duty to work, on the other a clear opposition between the
enslaved mass of working people and the ruling minority of non-workers.
And again, between the ancient slave economy of the Greeks or Romans,
and the medieval feudal economy, there is the powerful distinction that
ancient slavery eventually led to the downfall of Greco-Roman
civilization, whereas medieval feudalism threw up urban guild
handicrafts and urban trade, and in this way eventually generated modern
capitalism within its womb. Anyone, therefore, who brings under one
schema all these economic and social forms, these historical epochs,
that are in fact poles apart, must be applying a highly original measure
to economic epochs. The measure that Professor Bücher applies, in order
to create the night of his "self-contained domestic economy" in which
all cats are grey, he himself explains to us, by assisting our
understanding with a helpfully bracketed parenthesis. "Exchange-less
economy" means that first "stage" stretching from the beginning of
written history to the modern age, which is followed by the medieval
town as the "stage of direct exchange" and then by the present economic
system as the "stage of circulation of goods." We thus have
non-exchange, simple exchange or and complicated exchange -- or to put
it in more usual terms: absence of trade, simple trade, developed world
trade; this is the measure that Professor Bücher applies to economic
epochs. The main and basic problem of economic history for him is
whether the merchant has already made his appearance or not, whether he
is one and the same person as the producer, or a separate person. The
professor is very welcome to his "exchange-less economy," which is
nothing more than a professorial fantasy, still not discovered anywhere
on earth, and amounting to a historical invention of staggering boldness
in being applied to ancient Greece and Rome, or to the feudal Middle
Ages from the tenth century on. But to take as measure of the
development of production not relations of production but relations of
exchange, to take the merchant as the fulcrum of the economic system and
the measure of all things, even when he does not yet exist -- what a
brilliant result of "conceptual articulation, psychological-isolating
deduction," and above all, what "penetration into the essence of the
matter," which scorns "sticking to the surface"! Isn't the old
undemanding schema of the "historical school," the partition of economic
history into three epochs of "natural economy, money economy and credit
economy," much better and closer to reality than the pretentious
personal fabrication of Professor Bücher, who not only turns up his nose
at all "previous attempts of this kind," but takes as his own basic idea
the same rejected "sticking to the surface" of exchange, distorting it
by his pedantic word-spinning into a completely inappropriate schema?

"Sticking to the surface" of economic history is indeed no accident with
bourgeois science. Some bourgeois scholars, such as Friedrich List,
partition economic history according to the outward nature of the most
important sources of food, proposing epochs of hunting, stock raising,
agriculture and industry -- partitions that are not even adequate for an
external history of civilization. Others, such as Professor [Bruno]
Hildebrand, partition economic history according to the outward form of
exchange, into natural economy, money economy and credit economy, or
else, like Bücher, into an exchange-less economy, an economy with direct
exchange and one with commodity exchange. Still others, like Grosse,
take as their starting-point for judging economic forms the distribution
of goods. In a word, the scholars of the bourgeoisie push to the
forefront of historical consideration exchange, distribution,
consumption -- everything except the social form of _production_, which
is precisely what is decisive in every historical epoch, and from which
exchange and its various forms, distribution and consumption with their
particular features, always follow as logical consequences. Why is that?
For the same reason that moves them to present the "national economy"
i.e. the capitalist mode of production, as the highest and final stage
of human history, and to dispute its further world-economic development
and associated revolutionary tendencies. The social pattern of
production, that is, the question of the relationship of those who work
to the means of production, is the core point of each economic epoch,
but it is the sore point of every class society. The alienation of means
of production from the hands of those who work, in one or another form,
is the common foundation of all class society, since it is the basic
condition of all exploitation and class rule. To divert attention from
this sore point, and focus on everything external and secondary, is not
so much a deliberate effort on the part of bourgeois scholars as rather
the instinctive refusal of the class whose intellectual representatives
they are to eat the dangerous fruit of the tree of knowledge. And a
thoroughly modern and celebrated professor such as Bücher shows this
class instinct with his "insight of genius," when with a wave of the
hand he forces such major epochs as primitive communism, slavery and
serfdom, with their fundamentally different types of relation of
labor-power to the means of production, into one little box of his
schema, while permitting himself elaborate hair-splitting in relation to
the history of trade, distinguishing with pedantic self-importance, and
holding up to the light, "domestic work (in brackets: domestic tasks),"
"wage work," "handicraft," "work on the customer's premises," and
similar fatuous rubbish. The ideologists of the exploited masses, the
first communists, the earliest representatives of socialism, also
wandered in darkness and remained in limbo with their preaching of
equality among men, so long as they directed their accusations and
struggle principally against unjust distribution, or -- like some
socialists in the nineteenth century -- against modern forms of
exchange. Only after the best leaders of the working class realized that
the forms of distribution and exchange themselves depend on the
organization of production, for which the relationship of working people
to the means of production is decisive, only then were socialist
strivings placed on a firm scientific footing. And on the basis of this
unitary conception, the scientific position of the proletariat is
distinguished from that of the bourgeoisie in its approach to economic
history, just as it is in relation to political economy. If it lies in
the class interest of the bourgeoisie to conceal the crux of economic
history -- the pattern of the relationship of labor-power to the means
of production -- and its changing historical character, the interest of
the proletariat is conversely to bring this relationship to the fore and
make it the measure of a society's economic structure. And for this it
is not merely indispensable for workers to bear in mind the great
milestones of history that divide the ancient communistic society from
subsequent class society, but equally too the distinctions between the
various historical forms of class society themselves. Only by being
clear about the specific economic peculiarities of primitive communist
society, and the no less particular features of the ancient slave
economy and medieval serfdom, is it possible to grasp with due
thoroughness why today's capitalist class society offers for the first
time a historical leverage for the realization of socialism, and what
the fundamental distinction is between the world socialist economy of
the future and the primitive communist groups of primitive times.

## 3. Material on economic history (2)

### 3.1

Let us take a look at one of the mark communities that has been
researched most thoroughly in terms of its internal structures -- the
German.

As we know, the Germans settled by tribes and clans. In each clan, the
male head of the household was allocated a building site along with a
plot of land in order to set up house and farm there. A portion of the
land was then used for agriculture, and each family would obtain a lot
on it. It is true that according to Caesar, around the beginning of the
Christian era, one tribe of Germans (the Suevi or Swabians) cultivated
their farmland collectively without first partitioning it among the
families; yet yearly repartitioning of the lots was already a common
practice when the Roman historian Tacitus wrote, in the second century
CE. In isolated regions, such as around Frickhofen in Nassau, yearly
repartitioning still survived in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. In the nineteenth century, it was still the custom in a few
regions of the Bavarian Palatinate and on the Rhine to draw lots for
farmland, although they took place at longer intervals: every three,
four, nine, twelve, fourteen or eighteen years. This land, in other
words, was definitively turned into private property only around the
middle of the last century. In a few regions of Scotland as well, there
was repartitioning of farmland up until recently. All of the lots were
originally the same size, matching the average needs of a family as well
as the potential yield of the soil and the labor available. Depending on
the quality of soil in the various regions, they amounted to fifteen,
thirty, forty or more _Morgen_ of land. In most parts of Europe, the
lots were passed down by inheritance through individual families, as the
repartitioning of land became rare and eventually fell out of practice
in the fifth and sixth centuries. Still, this only applied to the farms.
All of the land that was left over -- woodland, meadows, bodies of water
and unused parts -- remained the unpartitioned, collective property of
the mark. From the yield of the woodland, for example, the needs of the
community were negotiated and what remained was distributed.

The pastures were used in common. This unpartitioned mark or common land
survived for a very long time; it still exists today in the Bavarian
Alps, Switzerland and the Tyrol, as well as in France (in the Vendée),
in Norway and Sweden.

In order to ensure complete equality in the partitioning of farmland,
the land was first divided by quality and situation into a few fields,
and each field was cut into several narrow strips corresponding to the
number of mark members. If a member of the mark had doubts about whether
he had received an equal share, he was allowed at any time to call for a
new measurement of the total land. Anyone who resisted him was punished.

But even after periodic repartitioning and allocation by lot fell into
disuse, the _work_ of all members of the mark community, including farm
work, remained totally communal and subject to strict regulation by the
collectivity. This meant above all the general obligation of everyone
possessing a share of the mark to work. Residency alone was not enough
to be an actual member of the mark. For this, each person not only had
to live in the mark, but also had to cultivate his holding himself.
Anyone who failed to cultivate his portion of land for a number of years
lost it for good, and the mark could hand it over to someone else to
cultivate. Work itself was also under the direction of the mark. In the
early period after the Germans established settlements, the centerpiece
of their economic life was stock raising, conducted on communal fields
and meadows under communal village herdsmen. They used fallow land as
pasture for livestock, as well as farmland after the harvest. This
followed already from the fact that the times for seeding and harvest,
the alternation between tilling and fallow years for each field, and the
sequence of sowings, were collectively decided and everyone had to
comply with the general arrangement. Each field was surrounded by a
fence with gates, and was closed from seedtime until harvest; the
opening and closing dates of the field were decided by the entire
village. Each field had an overseer, or field guardian, who had to
uphold the prescribed arrangement as a public official of the mark. The
so-called field processions of whole villages were organized as
festivals; children were also brought to these, and given a box on the
ear to make them remember the boundaries and be able to attest to them
later on.

Stock raising was conducted in common, and the members of the mark were
not allowed to keep individual herds. All the village's animals were
divided into common herds according to the kind of animal, each with its
own village herdsman and an animal to lead the herd. It was also decided
that the herds should have bells. In each mark, the right to hunt and
fish anywhere on its territory was also common. No snares could be laid,
nor any pits dug, without first notifying the rest of the community.
Mineral ore and the like that was dug out of the subsoil of the mark
from deeper than a ploughshare belonged to the community and not to the
individual finder. The craftsmen needed to reside in each mark. Each
farming family, indeed, made most of the items they needed for everyday
life themselves. They baked, brewed, spun and wove at home. Yet certain
crafts became specialized early on, especially those having to do with
the manufacture of farm implements. Thus, in the woodland community of
Wölpe in Lower Saxony, the members of the mark were to "have a man of
each craft in the forest to make useful things from wood." Everywhere,
it was decided what amount and kind of wood the craftsmen were to use,
in order to protect the forest and use only what was necessary for the
members of the mark. The craftsmen received their necessities from the
mark and generally lived the same way as the mass of other peasants. Yet
they did not have full rights, partly because they were transient and
not an indigenous element, and partly, which comes to the same thing,
because their main business was not agriculture, which was then the
center of gravity of economic life, around which public life and the
laws and duties of the mark members revolved. It was not possible,
therefore, for just anyone to join the mark community. The acceptance of
an outsider had to be unanimously approved by all of the members of the
mark. Anyone who wanted to transfer their lot could do so only to
another mark member, never an outsider, and only before the mark
tribunal.

At the head of the mark community was the _Dorfgraf_ or village mayor,
in other places called the _Markmeister_ or _Centener_. He was chosen
for this position by the mark members. Not only was this an honor for
the chosen individual, but also a duty; refusal would be penalized. With
the passage of time, the office of mark president became hereditary in
certain families, and because of its power and income, it was then only
a small step before this office could be bought, with the land becoming
a fiefdom, so that the position developed from that of a purely
democratic elected leader of the community into a tool for its
domination. In the heyday of the mark community, however, the mark
president was simply the executor of the wishes of the collectivity. The
assembly of the mark members regulated all communal affairs, reconciled
disputes and imposed punishments. The entire system of agricultural
work, paths and buildings as well as the field and village policing,
were all decided by majority in the assembly. The assembly was also
responsible for calculating from the "mark books," which had to be kept
on the mark's business. Maintaining the peace and administering justice
within the mark were carried out under the chairmanship of the mark
president by those in attendance (the "court of jurisdiction"), who
rendered judgments orally and publicly. Only members of the mark were
allowed to attend the tribunal; outsiders were denied entry. The members
of the mark were sworn to help and attest to one another, being
generally required to assist one another in a brotherly and loyal manner
in case of emergency, fire, or enemy attack. In the army, mark members
formed their own battalions and fought side by side. No one was allowed
to abandon his comrade to an enemy spear. When crimes and damages
occurred in the mark or were committed by a member of the mark against
an outsider, the whole mark banded together in solidarity. Members of
the mark were also obliged to harbor travelers and to support the needy.
Each mark originally formed a religious community, and after the
introduction of Christianity -- which in the case of the Germanic and
Saxon peoples was quite late, only in the ninth century -- the community
was a religious congregation. Finally, the mark typically kept a
schoolteacher for all the village youth.

It is impossible to imagine anything simpler and more harmonious than
the economic system of the old Germanic mark. The entire mechanism of
social life here is open to view. A strict plan and a tight organization
cover everything each individual does and place him as a part of the
whole. The immediate needs of everyday life, and the equal satisfaction
of everyone, is the starting point and end point of the whole
organization. Everyone works together for everyone else and collectively
decides on everything. But what does this organization spring from, what
is it based on, this power of the collective over the individual? It is
nothing other than the communism of land and soil, that is to say, the
common possession of the most important means of production by those who
work. The typical characteristics of the agrarian-communistic economic
organization can be brought out more easily if they are studied
comparatively at an international level, so that it can be grasped as a
global form of production in all its diversity and flexibility.

Let us turn to the old Inca Empire in South America. The territory of
this empire, which consisted of the present-day republics of Peru,
Bolivia and Chile, an area of 3,364,600 square kilometers with a present
population of twelve million inhabitants, was organized at the time of
the Spanish conquest under [Francisco] Pizarro in the same way it had
been for many centuries before. We find here right away the same
arrangements as among the ancient Germans. Each clan community, around a
hundred men capable of bearing weapons, occupied a particular area that
henceforth belonged to them as their _marca_, even this term curiously
resembling the German. The mark's farmland was separated off, divided
into portions and allocated annually to families by lot before the
sowing of crops. The size of the portions was determined by family size,
i.e. according to their needs. The village leader, whose position had
already developed from an elected one into a hereditary one by the time
of the formation of the Inca Empire in the tenth and eleventh centuries,
received the largest allotted share. In northern Peru, the male heads of
household did not all cultivate their plots of land themselves, but
worked in groups of ten under the direction of a leader -- an
arrangement that resembles certain aspects of the Germanic structure.
This ten-man group cultivated in rotation the lots of all of its
members, including those who were absent, on war service, or doing
_corvée_ labor for the Incas. Each family received the products that
grew on its lot. Only those who lived in the _marca_ and belonged to the
clan had the right to a plot of land. Yet everyone was also obliged to
cultivate his plot himself. Anyone who let his field lie fallow for a
certain number of years (in Mexico, it was three) lost his claim to his
land. The plots could not be sold or given away. It was strictly
forbidden to leave one's own _marca_ and settle in another one, this
fact probably being connected to the strict blood ties of the village
tribes.

Agriculture in the coastal regions, where there is only periodic
rainfall, always required artificial irrigation by means of canals,
which were constructed by the collective labor of the entire _marca_.
There were strict rules governing the use of water and its distribution,
both between different villages and within them. Each village also had
"paupers' fields," which were cultivated by all the members of the
_marca_ and whose products the village leaders distributed among the
elderly, widows, and other needy individuals. All land outside the
tilled fields was _marcapacha_ (common land). In the mountainous region
of the country, where agriculture could not thrive, there was modest
livestock farming, consisting almost exclusively of llamas, the basis of
existence for these inhabitants, who periodically brought their main
product, wool, down to the valley in order to trade it with the peasants
for corn, pepper and beans. At the time of the conquest there were
already private herds and significant differences in wealth in the
mountain regions. An average member of the mark probably owned between
three and ten llamas, while a chief might have between fifty and a
hundred. Only the forest, soil and pasture were common property there,
and as well as private herds there were village ones, which could not be
divided up. At certain times, some of the communal herd were slaughtered
and the meat and wool divided among the families. There were no
specialized craftsmen; each family made the necessary household items
itself. There were, however, villages with special skill in a certain
craft, whether as weavers, potters, or metal workers. At the head of the
village was the village leader, originally an elected office but later a
hereditary one, who oversaw the cultivation, but in every important
matter he consulted with the assembly of all adults, which was called
together by sounding a conch shell.

Thus far, the ancient Peruvian _marca_ offers a faithful copy of the
German mark community in all essential characteristics. Yet it offers us
more in our investigation of the essence of this social system by
deviating from the pattern we already know, than it does in its
similarities. What was unique in the old Inca Empire is that it was a
conquered land on which foreign rule was established. The immigrant
conquerors, the Incas, were indeed an Indian tribe, yet they were able
to subjugate the peaceful Quechua tribes who lived there because of the
isolation in which these lived in their villages, concerned only with
their own _marca_ and its boundaries, unconnected to any larger
territory, and uninterested in anything that existed or occurred beyond
their own borders. This extremely particularistic social organization,
which made the Inca conquest so effortless, was barely touched or
altered by the Incas themselves. Yet they did graft onto it a refined
system of economic exploitation and political domination. Each conquered
_marca_ had to give up a part of its own land for "Inca fields" and
"fields of the sun." Though these continued to belong to it, their
products had to be turned over to the ruling Inca tribe and its priestly
caste. Similarly, they had to reserve a portion of their livestock in
the mountainous _marcas_ as "herds of the masters" and mark them as
such. The protection of these herds as well as the cultivation of the
fields for the Incas and their priests was based upon the compulsory
labor of all members of the _marca_. On top of this there was compulsory
labor for mining, likewise for public works such as road and bridge
construction under the control of the rulers; a strictly disciplined
military service; and finally a tribute of young girls, who were used by
the Incas for ritual sacrifice or as concubines. This tight system of
exploitation, however, did not interfere with the internal life of the
_marca_ and its communist-democratic organization; even the compulsory
labor and dues were borne communistically as a collective burden of the
mark. Yet what is remarkable is that this communistic village
organization did not simply prove a solid and amenable basis for a
centuries-long system of exploitation and servitude, as so often happens
in history, but that this system was itself organized on a communistic
basis. The Incas who ensconced themselves on the backs of the subjugated
Peruvian tribes themselves also lived in clan groups with mark-type
relations. Their capital, the town of Cuzco, was simply a combination of
a dozen or two collective quarters, each the seat of a communistic
household for a whole clan, complete with a communal burial area, and a
common cult as well. Around these tribal houses lay the mark regions of
the Inca clans, with unpartitioned forests and pastures and partitioned
farmland, which was likewise cultivated in common. Being a primitive
people, these exploiters and rulers had not yet renounced work
themselves; they used their position of domination only to live better
than the dominated and to make more opulent sacrificial offerings. The
modern art of having one's food supplied by other people's labor and
making refusal to work an attribute of domination was still foreign to
the nature of this social organization, in which collective property and
the general duty to work were deep-seated customs. The exercise of
political domination was also organized as a collective function of the
Inca clans. The Inca governors appointed to the Peruvian provinces,
analogous in their role to the Dutch residents of the Malaysian
archipelago, were seen as delegates of their clans in Cuzco, where they
retained residency in the collective quarters and participated in their
own mark community. Each year, these delegates returned home for the Sun
Festival in Cuzco to render an account of their official activities and
to celebrate the great religious festival with their fellow clansmen.

What we have here, as it were, is two social strata, one above the other
yet both internally communistic in their organization, standing in a
relationship of exploitation and subjugation. This phenomenon may seem
incomprehensible at first, being as it is in stark contradiction with
the principles of equality, brotherhood and democracy that form the
basis of the organization of the mark community. But we also have here
living proof of just how little in reality the primitive communist
structures had to do with general freedom and equality. These expanded,
generically valid "principles" applying to all abstract "human beings,"
or all people of the "civilized" countries, i.e., countries of
capitalist civilization, were only a late product of modern bourgeois
society, whose revolutions -- in America as well as France -- proclaimed
them for the first time. Primitive communist society knew no such
general principles for all human beings; their equality and solidarity
grew out of the traditions of common blood ties and out of common
ownership of the means of production. As far as these blood ties and
common ownership reached, so too did the equality of rights and
solidarity of interests. Whatever lay beyond these limits -- which were
no wider than the walls of a village, or at most the territorial
boundaries of a tribe -- was foreign and could even be hostile. Indeed,
each community based on economic solidarity could and necessarily was
periodically driven into deadly conflicts of interest with similarly
constructed communities because of the low level of development of
production, or because of the scarcity or exhaustion of food sources due
to an increase in population. Brute struggle, war, had to decide, and
its result often meant the eradication of one of the contending parties,
or more frequently, the establishment of a system of exploitation. It
was not devotion to abstract principles of equality and freedom that
formed the basis of primitive communism, but the pitiless necessities of
a low level of human civilization, the helplessness of humanity in the
face of external nature, which forced them to stick closely together in
larger alliances, and to act methodically and collectively with respect
to labor and the struggle for life as an absolute condition of
existence. Yet it was also the same limited control over nature that
confined planning and action with respect to labor to a relatively quite
small area of natural pasture or reclaimable village settlements, and
made this unsuitable for collective action on a larger scale. The
primitive state of agriculture at that time did not allow for any larger
cultivation than that of a village mark, and for this reason presented
strict limits to the solidarity of interests. And finally, it was the
same inadequate development of labor productivity that also generated
periodic conflicts of interest among the various social alliances,
thereby making brute force the only means to solve such conflicts. War
thus became a permanent method for solving conflicts of interest between
social communities, a method that would prevail through to the highest
development of labor productivity -- the total domination of man over
nature -- that will put an end to material conflicts of interest between
people. If clashes between different primitive communist societies were
indeed a common occurrence, it was the development of labor productivity
at the time that decided the outcome. When there was a conflict between
two nomadic, herding peoples who had come into conflict over livestock
pastures, only brute force could determine who would remain master of
the land and who would be driven into drought-ridden, inhospitable
regions or even be exterminated. Yet wherever agriculture was already
sufficiently flourishing to nourish people well and securely, without
taking up the entire labor force and the entire lifetime of these
individuals, there was also the foundation for a systematic exploitation
of these peasants by foreign conquerors. And this explains the relations
that emerge, as in Peru, when one communistic community establishes
itself as the exploiter of another.

The unique structure of the Inca Empire is important because it offers
us the key to understanding a whole series of similar patterns in
classical antiquity, especially those in the earliest period of Greek
history. If, for example, we have a brief surviving account how on the
island of Crete, which was ruled by the Dorians, the subjugated people
had to hand over their entire harvest, less the sustenance required for
themselves and their families, to the community, to cover the communal
meals of the free men (the ruling Dorians); or that in Sparta, likewise
a Dorian community, there were "state slaves" or Helots, who were given
"from the state" to individuals to work their farmland, at first this
kind of thing presents a puzzle. And a bourgeois scholar, Professor Max
Weber in Heidelberg, proposes a curious hypothesis based on the
standpoint of present-day condition and concepts, in order to explain
these curious historical phenomena:

>The dominated population is treated here [in Sparta -- R.L.] in the
>same manner as in state slavery or bondage. The sustenance of the
>warriors is deducted from agricultural production, partly in the
>collective manner that we have already mentioned, and partly in such a
>way that the individual is dependent on the yield of certain plots of
>land worked by slaves that are allocated to him, which are appropriated
>in one way or another, later increasingly through inheritance. New
>allocations of lots and other kinds of distribution were historically
>considered to be practicable and appear to have occurred. Naturally,
>they are not reallocation of _farmland_ ["natural" is not something a
>bourgeois professor should concede, regardless of what it is about --
>R.L.] but rather a kind of reallocation of _ground rent_. Military
>considerations, especially a military population policy, determine all
>the particulars ... The _urban-feudal_ character of this politics is
>characteristically expressed in the way that in Gortyn, the plots of
>land occupied by serfs in the estate of a free man are subject to
>military law: they form the _kleros_, which is bound to the maintenance
>of the military family.

Translated from the academic into regular speech: the farmlands are the
property of the whole community and thus may not be sold nor distributed
after the death of the owner. Professor Weber explains this at another
point as a wise measure "to prevent the fragmentation of wealth" and "in
the interest of maintaining lots appropriate for the class of warriors."

>The organization culminates in a mess-like community dinner table of
>the warriors, the "syssities," and in the communal education of
>children by the state, in order to make them into warriors.

In this way the Greeks of the heroic age, the age of Hector and Achilles
-- who happily possess the notions of annuities [_Rentenanstalten_] and
the Prussian _Fideikommis_, of officers' messes with their "class
appropriate" champagne toasts -- the blossoming, naked boys and girls of
Sparta who enjoyed a national education, are all transformed into a
jail-like institution for cadets such as that at Gross-Lichterfelde near
Berlin.

The relations described above will not present much difficulty for
someone familiar with the internal structure of the Inca Empire. They
are undoubtedly the product of a similarly blatantly parasitic dual
structure that has emerged from the subjugation of an agricultural mark
community by another communistic community. The extent to which the
communistic foundation remains in the customs of the rulers as well as
in the situation of the subjugated depends on the stage of development,
the length and the environment of this pattern, all of which can offer a
whole range of gradations. The Inca Empire, where the rulers themselves
still labor, where the landownership of the subjects as a whole is not
yet touched and each social stratum is cohesively organized, can indeed
be viewed as the original form of such exploitative relations, which was
only able to preserve itself for centuries thanks to the country's
relatively primitive level of culture and isolation from the rest of the
world. The historical information on Crete, drawn from traditional
sources, suggests an advanced stage where the subjugated peasant
community had to hand over all the fruits of its labor less what was
needed for its own subsistence, where the ruling community lived not
from their own labor in the fields, but from the dues paid to them by
the exploited mark community, although this still had its own
consumption in common. In Sparta we find -- at a further stage of
development -- that the land is no longer seen as belonging to the
subjugated community, but is rather the property of the rulers, being
repartitioned and allotted by lot _among themselves_ in the manner of
the mark community. The social organization of the subjugated is
shattered by the loss of its foundation, ownership of the land; they
themselves become the property of the ruling community, who
communistically, or "for the sake of the state," hand over the landless
to individual mark members as laborers. The ruling Spartans themselves
continue to live in strict relations characteristic of the mark
community. And similar relations are supposed to have prevailed to a
certain degree in Thessaly, where the previous inhabitants, the
_Penestai_ or "poor people," were subjugated by the Aeolians, or in
Bithynia, where the _Mariandynoi_ were placed in a similar situation by
Thracian tribes. Such a parasitic existence, however, constantly led to
the seeds of disintegration being also brought into the ruling
community. Conquest, and the imperative to establish exploitation as a
permanent structure, already leads to a considerable development of the
military apparatus, as we see in both the Inca state and the Spartan
ones. This is the first precondition for inequality, for the formation
of privileged classes, in the womb of the originally free and equal mass
of peasants. It only requires favorable geographical and
cultural-historical circumstances, which arouse more refined needs by
contact with more civilized peoples and brisk trade, in order for
inequality to make rapid progress even within the ruling classes, for
the communistic cohesion to weaken, and for private property to enter
the field with its division of rich and poor. The early history of the
Greek world, after its contact with the civilized peoples of the Orient,
is a classic example of such a development. Thus, the result of the
subjugation of one early communistic society by another, whether sooner
or later, is always the same: the unraveling of communistic, traditional
social bonds among both the rulers and the ruled, and the birth of a
totally new social formation in which private property along with
inequality and exploitation, each engendering the other, enter the world
right away. And thus the history of the old mark community in classical
antiquity leads, on the one hand, to the opposition between a mass of
indebted small peasants and an aristocracy that has appropriated
military service, public offices, trade and the undivided communal lands
as large-scale landed property; and on the other hand, to the opposition
between this whole society of free people and the exploited _slaves_. It
was only one step from this differentiated natural economy based on
communal exploitation of a people subjected militarily to introducing
the purchase of individual slaves. And this step was taken quickly in
Greece by virtue of maritime and international trade, with its effects
in the coastal and island states. [Ettore] Ciccotti also distinguishes
between two types of slavery: "The oldest, most significant and most
widespread form of economic servitude," he says,

>which we see at the threshold of Greek history, is not slavery, but a
>form of bondage that I would almost like to call vassalage. According
>to Theopompus [of Chios]: "Among all Hellenes after the Thessalians and
>the Lacedaemonians, the inhabitants of the island of Chios in Asia
>Minor were the first to use slaves, but they did not acquire them in
>the same manner as others ... It is clear that the Lacedaemonians and
>Thessalians formed their slave class out of Hellenes who previously
>inhabited this part of the world they now owned, so that they forced
>the Achaeans, Thessalians, Perrebes and Magnetes into servitude and
>named these subjugated peoples Helots and _Penestai_. In contrast, the
>inhabitants of Chios acquired barbarian non-Greeks as slaves and paid a
>price for them."

And the reason for this distinction, Ciccotti correctly points out,

>lay in the different level of development of the inland peoples on the
>one hand and the island peoples on the other. Complete absence or a
>very low degree of accumulation of wealth, along with the weak
>development of commercial trade, in the one case excluded a direct and
>growing production on the part of the owners as well as their direct
>employment of slaves, leading instead to the more rudimentary form of
>tribute and to a division of labor and formation of a class system that
>created a body of armed soldiers out of the ruling class and a farming
>peasantry out of the subjugated peoples.

The internal organization of the Peruvian Inca state reveals to us an
important aspect of this primitive social form, indicating at the same
time a particular historic process of its downfall. A different turn in
the fate of this social form will appear when we trace the subsequent
episode in the history of the Peruvian Indians as well as that of the
other Spanish colonies in America. Here we particularly encounter a
completely new method of domination, which had no parallel with the Inca
rulers, for example. The Spanish, the first Europeans in the New World,
began their rule with the relentless extermination of the subjugated
population. According to the reports of the Spanish themselves, the
number of Indians exterminated in the space of only a few years after
the discovery of America reached a total of between twelve and fifteen
million. "We believe it justified to maintain," [Bartolomé de] Las Casas
says, "that the Spanish, through their monstrous and inhuman treatment,
have exterminated twelve million people, among them women and children."
He further states, "In my personal opinion, the number of those natives
murdered in this period exceeded even fifteen million." "On the island
of Haiti," says [Heinrich Gottfried] Handelmann, "the number of natives
before the Spanish encountered them in 1492 was around one million; by
1508 only sixty thousand of these million people remained, and nine
years later there were only fourteen thousand, so that the Spanish had
to resort to introducing Indians from the neighboring islands in order
to have enough working hands. In 1508 alone, forty thousand natives from
the Bahamas were transported to the island of Haiti and made into
slaves." The Spanish regularly hunted down the redskins, as described
for us by an eyewitness and participant, the Italian Girolamo Benzoni.
"In part because of a lack of food, and in part out of fear following
separation from their fathers, mothers, and children," says Benzoni
after one such manhunt on the island of Kumagna, in which four thousand
Indians were captured,

>the majority of the enslaved natives died on the way to the port of
>Cumana. Each time that one of the slaves was too tired to march as
>quickly as his comrades, the Spanish stabbed him in the back with their
>daggers, inhumanly murdering him out of fear that he wanted to remain
>in order to lead a counterattack. It was a heart-breaking scene to see
>these poor souls, totally naked, tired, wounded and so exhausted from
>hunger that they could hardly stand on their feet. Iron chains bound
>their necks, hands and feet. There was not a virgin among them who
>would not be raped by these robbers, who were so addicted to this
>repulsive debauchery that many of them remained marred by syphilis
>forever ... All the natives taken as slaves were branded with hot
>irons. The captains then took a number of them for themselves, dividing
>the rest among the soldiers. They either gambled them away to one
>another or sold them to Spanish colonists. Merchants who traded this
>commodity for wine, flour, sugar and other daily necessities,
>transported the slaves to those parts of the Spanish colonies where
>there was the greatest demand for them. During their transport, a
>number of these unfortunates died from lack of water and the bad air in
>the cabins, which was due to the fact that the traders herded the
>slaves into the lowest level of the ship without giving them enough
>water to drink or enough air to breathe.

However, in order to relieve themselves of the trouble of pursuing the
Indians and the cost of buying them, the Spanish created a system known
as _repartimientos_ in their West Indian possessions and on the American
mainland. The entire conquered area was divided by the governors into
districts, whose village leaders, _caciques_, were themselves obliged to
supply on demand the number of natives for slavery requested by the
Spanish. Each Spanish colonist periodically received the requested
number of slaves that were delivered to him by the governor under the
condition that he "take the trouble to convert them to Christianity."
The abuse of the slaves by the colonists defied all understanding.
Suicide became a salvation for the Indians. "All of the natives captured
by the Spanish," according to one witness,

>were forced by them to do hard and exhausting labor in the mines, away
>from their homes and families and under constant threat of beatings. No
>wonder that thousands of slaves saw no other possibility than to escape
>from their gruesome fate by not only violently taking their own lives,
>by hanging or drowning themselves or in other ways, but first also
>murdering their wives and children, in order to end an unfortunate and
>inescapable situation for everyone all at once. In other cases, women
>resorted to aborting their children in the womb or avoiding sexual
>contact with men so that they did not have to bear slaves.

Through the intervention of the imperial confessor, the pious Father
Garcia [Juan] de Loaysa, the colonists were finally able to have a
decree issued by the Hapsburg emperor, Charles V, summarily declaring
the Indians to be hereditary slaves of the Spanish colonists. Benzoni in
fact says the decree only applied to Caribbean cannibals, but was
extended and applied to all Indians in general. In order to justify
their atrocities, the Spanish systematically spread dramatic horror
stories about cannibalism and other vices of the Indians so that a
contemporary French historian, Marly de Châtel, in his "General History
of the West Indies" (Paris 1569) could write of them: "God punished them
with slavery for their evil and vice, since not even Ham sinned against
his father Noah to the degree of the Indians against the Holy Father."
And around the same time the Spaniard [José de] Acosta wrote in his
_Historia natural y moral de las Indias_ (Barcelona, 1591) about these
same Indians, that they were a "good-natured people who are always ready
to prove themselves of service to the Europeans; a people who, in their
behavior, show such a touching harmlessness and sincerity, that those
not completely stripped of all humanity could not treat them in any
other way than with tenderness and love."

Naturally, there were also attempts to stop the horror. In 1531, Pope
Paul III published a bull decreeing that the Indians were members of the
human race and therefore free from slavery. The Spanish Imperial Council
for the West Indies also made a declaration against slavery, but the
need for these repeated decrees testified more to the fruitlessness of
these attempts than to their sincerity.

What freed the Indians from slavery was neither the pious actions of the
Catholic clergy nor the protests of the Spanish kings, but rather the
simple fact that the Indians' mental and physical constitution rendered
them worthless for hard slave labor. Against this bare impossibility,
the worst cruelty of the Spanish did not help in the long run; the
redskins died under slavery like flies, fled, took their own lives -- in
short, the entire business was thoroughly unprofitable. And only when
the warm and untiring defender of the Indians, Bishop Las Casas, hit
upon the idea of importing the more robust Africans as slaves in place
of the unfit Indians, were the useless experiments with the Indians
immediately abandoned. This practical discovery had a quicker and more
thorough effect than all of Las Casas's pamphlets on the cruelties of
the Spanish. The Indians were freed from slavery after a few decades and
the enslavement of the Negroes began, which would last for four more
centuries. At the end of the eighteenth century a respectable German,
"good old [Joachim Christian] Nettelbeck" from Kolberg, was the captain
of a ship taking hundreds of Africans from Guinea to Guyana in South
America, where other "good East Prussians" exploited plantations and
sold slaves along with other goods from Africa, herding them into the
lowest parts of the ship, as the Spanish captains had done in the
sixteenth century. The progress of the humanitarian era of the
Enlightenment showed itself in the way that Nettelbeck, to alleviate
their melancholy and to keep them from dying off, allowed the slaves to
dance on the ship's deck with music and whip cracks every evening,
something to which the more brutal Spanish traders had not yet resorted.
And in 1871, in the late nineteenth century, the noble David
Livingstone, who had spent thirty years in Africa searching for the
sources of the Nile, wrote in his famous letters to the American [James]
Gordon Bennett:

>And if my disclosures regarding the terrible Ujijian slavery should
>lead to the suppression of the east coast slave trade, I shall regard
>that as a greater matter by far than the discovery of all the Nile
>sources together. Now that you have done with domestic slavery forever,
>lend us your powerful aid toward this great object. This fine country
>is blighted, as with a curse from above ...

Yet the lot of the Indians in the Spanish colonies was not made
significantly better by this transformation. A new system of
colonization simply took the place of the old one. Instead of
_repartimientos_, which were created for the direct enslavement of the
population, the so-called _encomiendas_ were introduced. Formally, the
inhabitants were awarded personal freedom and full property rights to
their land. But these areas were under the administrative direction of
the Spanish colonists, in particular in the hands of the descendants of
the first _conquistadores_, and these _encomenderos_ were to be the
guardians of the Indians, who were for their part declared to be legal
minors. The _encomenderos_ were supposed to spread Christianity among
the Indians. To cover the cost of constructing churches for the natives
and as compensation for their labor as guardians, the _encomenderos_
legally acquired the right to demand "moderate payments in money and in
kind" from the population. These provisions soon were enough to make the
_encomiendas_ hell for the Indians. The land was indeed left to them as
the undivided property of the tribes, but the Spanish only understood,
or only wanted to understand, this to be farmland, land that was under
the plough. The undivided mark as well as unused lands, often even
fields left to lie fallow, were taken over by the Spanish as "waste
land." And they did this with such thoroughness and shamelessness that
[Alonzo de] Zurita wrote on this subject:

>There is not a parcel of land, not a farm, that was not determined to
>be the property of the Europeans, without regard for the encroachments
>onto the interests and the property rights of the natives, who were
>thus forced to leave this land, which had been inhabited by them since
>ancient times. Cultivated land was often seized from them, under the
>pretext that this was being utilized only to prevent its acquisition by
>the Europeans. Thanks to this system, in some provinces the Spanish
>expanded their property so widely that the natives had no land left to
>cultivate themselves.

At the same time, the "moderate" payments were increased so shamelessly
by the _encomenderos_ that the Indians were crushed under them. "All of
the belongings of the Indian," Zurita says,

>are not enough to pay the taxes that are levied on him. You meet many
>people among the redskins whose assets do not even come to one _peso_
>and who live from daily wage-labor; these unfortunates, accordingly,
>having nothing left with which to support their families. This is the
>reason why so often young people prefer sexual relations out of
>wedlock, especially when their parents do not even have four or five
>_reales_ at their disposal. The Indians can scarcely afford the luxury
>of clothing themselves; many who have no resources to buy themselves
>clothes are not able to take communion. It is no wonder, then, that the
>majority of them become desperate, since they cannot find any way to
>acquire the food needed for their families ... During my early travels,
>I discovered that many Indians hanged themselves out of despair, after
>explaining to their wives and children that they were doing this in the
>face of the impossibility of meeting the taxes demanded of them.

Finally, in addition to increasing land theft and pressure of taxation,
came forced labor. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the
Spanish openly returned to the system that had been formally abandoned
in the sixteenth century. Though slavery was abolished for the Indians,
in its place came a unique system of forced wage labor, which did not
significantly differ from the system that preceded it. Already in the
mid-sixteenth century, Zurita portrays for us the situation of the
Indian wage laborers under the Spanish in the following way:

>The whole time, the Indians received no other nourishment than
>cornbread ... The _encomendor_ has them work from morning to night,
>naked in the morning and evening frosts, in storms and thunder, without
>giving them any food other than half-spoiled bread. The Indians spend
>the night under the open sky. Because the wage is only paid at the end
>of their term of forced labor, the Indians have no means to buy the
>necessary warm clothing for themselves. It is no surprise that under
>such circumstances, the work in the _encomenderos_ is utterly
>exhausting for them and can be identified as one of the reasons for the
>Indians dying off so rapidly.

This system of forced wage labor was introduced at the beginning of the
seventeenth century by the Spanish crown, making it officially and
universally legal. The stated reason for the law was that the Indians
would not work voluntarily and that without them the mines could only be
run with great difficulty, despite the presence of the African slaves.
The Indian villagers were thus required to provide the number of workers
demanded (in Peru, a seventh of the population, in New Spain, 4
percent), and these were at the mercy of the _encomenderos_. The deadly
consequences of this system were immediately apparent. An anonymous
memorandum sent to Philip IV, under the title "Report on the Dangerous
Situation of the Kingdom of Chile from the Temporal and Spiritual Point
of View," stated:

>The known cause of the rapid decrease in the number of natives is the
>system of forced labor in the mines and on the fields of the
>_encomenderos_. Although the Spanish have an enormous number of Negroes
>at their disposal, although they have taxed the Indians at a higher
>rate than they paid their leaders before the conquest, they
>nevertheless regard it as impossible to give up this system of forced
>labor.

In addition, forced labor resulted in the Indians in many cases being
unable to cultivate their fields, which the Spanish then used as a
pretext to seize the land for themselves as "waste land." The ruin of
Indian farming offered a fertile ground for extortion. "Among their
native rulers," according to Zurita, "the Indians did not know any
usurers." The Spanish taught them very well these blessings of money
economy and taxation. Eaten up by debt, huge lands owned by the Indians
-- those that had not already been simply stolen by the Spanish -- fell
into the hands of Spanish capitalists, with the assessment of their
value forming a special example of European perfidy. Between them, the
theft of land, taxation, forced labor and usury formed a tight circle in
which the existence of the Indian mark community collapsed. The
traditional public order and customary social bonds of the Indians were
dissolved by the collapse of their economic base -- mark community
farming. For their part, the Spanish methodically destroyed it by
disrupting all traditional forms of authority. The village and tribal
chiefs had to be confirmed by the _encomenderos_, who used this
prerogative to fill these positions with their own protégés, the most
depraved subjects of Indian society. Another favorite method of the
Spanish was the systematic instigation of the Indians against their
leaders. Under the auspices of their Christian aims, of protecting the
natives from being exploited by their chiefs, they declared them free
from paying the dues that these had received since time immemorial. "The
Spanish," writes Zurita, "based on what is happening in Mexico today,
maintain that the chiefs are plundering their own tribes, but they bear
the blame for this extortion, since they themselves and no one else
robbed the former chiefs of their position and income and replaced them
with ones from among their protégés." Likewise, they looked to instigate
mutinies whenever village or tribal chiefs protested against illicit
lands sales to the Spanish by individual members of the mark. The result
was chronic revolts, and an endless succession of legal proceedings over
unlawful land sales among the natives themselves. Along with ruin,
hunger, and slavery, anarchy added to the mix that made the existence of
the Indians hell. The stark result of this Spanish-Christian
guardianship can be summed up in two phrases: the land going into the
hands of the Spanish, and the extinction of the Indians. "In all the
Spanish areas of the Indies," Zurita writes,

>either the native tribes disappear completely or they become much
>smaller, although others have claimed the opposite. The natives leave
>their dwellings and farms, since these have lost all value for them in
>the face of the exorbitant dues in money and kind; they emigrate to
>other regions, continuously wandering from one region to another, or
>they hide themselves in the forest and run the danger of becoming,
>sooner or later, the prey of wild animals. Many Indians end their lives
>by suicide, as I personally witnessed several times and learned from
>interviews with the local population.

And half a century later, another high official of the Spanish
government in Peru, Juan Ortiz de Cervantes, reported:

>The native population in the Spanish colonies grow ever more thin on
>the ground; they abandon the areas they formerly inhabited, leaving the
>soil uncultivated, and the Spanish have to struggle to find the
>necessary number of peasants and herdsmen. The so-called Mitayos, a
>tribe without whom work in the gold and silver mines would be
>impossible, either completely abandon the cities occupied by the
>Spanish, or if they stay, die out at an astonishing rate.

We may truly wonder at the incredible tenacity of the Indian people and
their mark community institutions, since remains of both persisted well
into the nineteenth century, despite these conditions.

The great English colony of India shows us another aspect of the fate of
the mark community. Here, as in no other corner of the earth, one can
study the most varying forms of property that represent the history of
several millennia, like [William] Herschel's "star gages" model of the
sky projected onto a flat surface. Village communities alongside tribal
communities; periodic repartitionings of equal portions of land
alongside lifelong ownership of unequal portions of land; communal labor
alongside private individual enterprise; equal rights of all villagers
to community lands alongside the privileges of certain groups; and
finally, beside all these forms of communal property, private property
in land in the form of smaller subplots of rural land, short-term
leaseholds, and enormous latifundia. All of this could still be observed
in India, as large as life, a few decades ago. Indian legal sources
attest that the mark community in India is an ancient system. The oldest
common law, the Code of Manu from the ninth century BC, contains
countless ordinances concerning border disputes between mark
communities, unpartitioned marks, and the new settlement of daughter
villages on unpartitioned land of older marks. The code knows only
ownership based on one's own labor; it mentions handicrafts only as a
side-occupation of agriculture; it attempts to rein in the power of the
Brahmins, the priests, by only allowing them to be granted moveable
property. The future indigenous sovereigns, the rajas, appear in these
codes still as elected tribal high chiefs. The two later codes,
Yajnavalkya and Narada, which are from the fifth century, recognize the
clan as the social organization, with public and judicial authority
lying in the hands of the assembly of mark members. These are, jointly
and collectively, responsible for the misdeeds and crimes of
individuals. Standing at the head of the village is the elected mark
leader. Both legal codes advise electing the best, most peace-loving and
most even-handed community member to this office and offering him
unconditional obedience. The Code of Narada already distinguishes
between two kinds of mark communities: "relatives" or clan-based
communities, and "cohabitants" or neighboring communities as local
associations of non-blood relatives. Yet, at the same time, both legal
codes only recognize ownership based on individual labor. Abandoned land
belongs to the person who takes it over for cultivation. Illegal
occupation is still not recognized after three generations if the
individuals in question do not cultivate the land. Up to this point, we
therefore see the Indian people still enclosed within the same primitive
social groups and economic relations, as they existed for centuries in
the Indus region and subsequently in the heroic period of the Ganges
conquest, from which the great folk epics of the _Ramayana_ and the
_Mahabharata_ were born. It is only in the commentaries on the old legal
codes, which are always the characteristic symptom of deep social
changes and aspirations, that one sees old legal views reinterpreted in
the light of new interests. This is clear proof that up to the
fourteenth century -- the epoch of the commentators -- Indian society
went through significant adjustments in its social structure. In the
meantime, an influential priestly class had developed, rising above the
mass of peasants both materially and legally. These commentators -- just
like their Christian colleagues in the feudal West -- seek to "explain"
the precise language of the old legal codes in such a way as to justify
priestly ownership of property and encourage the donation of land to the
Brahmins, and in this way promote the division of the mark lands and the
formation of clerical landed property at the expense of the mass of
peasant farmers. This development was typical of the fate of all
Oriental societies.

The life-and-death question for every form of developed agriculture in
most parts of the Orient is irrigation. We see at an early date in
India, just as in Egypt, large-scale irrigation systems as a solid
foundation for agriculture, along with canals, streams and systematic
precautionary measures to protect the land from periodic flooding. From
the outset, all of these large undertakings were beyond the capacity of
the individual mark community, in terms of the forces, initiative and
planning they required. Their direction and execution were the work of
an authority that stood above the individual village marks, one that
could bring labor-power together on a larger scale. Also required was a
mastery of natural laws greater than that available to the observational
and experiential world of the mass of peasants, enclosed in the limits
of their villages. Out of these needs arose the important function of
the priests in the Orient, who were able to direct large public works
such as irrigation systems by virtue of their observation of nature,
this being an integral part of every nature-based religion; the priests'
exemption from direct participation in agricultural labor, a freedom
that was the product of a certain stage of development, allowed them to
direct the irrigation work. Naturally, over time, this purely economic
function grew into a particular type of social power held by the
priests. The specialization of these members of society, which emerged
from the division of labor, turned into a hereditary, exclusive caste
with privileges over the peasant masses and an interest in their
exploitation. The pace and extent of this process for a particular
people, whether it remained embryonic as in the case of the Peruvian
Indians, or developed into official state rule by the priestly caste,
theocracy, as in Egypt or among the ancient Hebrews, was always
dependent on the specific geographical and historical circumstances. But
it also depended on whether frequent contact with surrounding peoples
allowed a strong warrior caste to emerge outside of the priestly caste,
and raise itself up as a military aristocracy in competition with or
indeed above the priests. In either case, it was the case again here
that the specific, particularistic narrowness of the ancient communistic
mark, with an organization unsuited for larger economic or political
tasks, forced it to cede these functions to forces that dominated it
from outside. These functions so surely offered the key to the political
domination and economic exploitation of the peasant masses, that all
barbarian conquerors in the Orient, whether Mongols, Persians, or Arabs,
were forced, alongside their military power, to take control of the
management and execution of the large public undertakings required for
the agricultural economy. Just as the Incas in Peru regarded the
supervision of artificial irrigation projects and of road and bridge
construction as not only a privilege but a duty, so the various Asiatic
despotic dynasties that succeeded one another in India applied
themselves just as diligently. Despite the formation of castes, despite
despotic foreign rule over the country, and despite political upheavals,
the tranquil village pursued its existence in the depths of Indian
society. Within each village the ancient traditional statutes of the
mark constitution prevailed, continuing beneath the storms of political
history its own calm and unremarked internal history, shedding old forms
and adopting new ones, experiencing prosperity and decline, dissolution
and regeneration. No chronicler ever portrayed these events, and when
world history describes the bold campaign of Alexander [the Great] of
Macedon all the way to the sources of the Indus, and is full of the
battle sounds of bloody Timur and it remains completely silent about the
internal economic history of the Indian people. It is only from
survivals of the various ancient layers of this history that we can
reconstruct Indian society's hypothetical pattern of development, and it
is the achievement of Kovalevsky to have unraveled this. According to
Kovalevsky, the various types of agrarian communities that were still
observed in the mid-nineteenth century in India can be placed in the
following historical sequence:

1: The oldest form is that of the pure clan community, comprising the
totality of blood relatives in a clan or kinship group, which owns the
land in common and cultivates it communally. Here the communal land is
therefore unpartitioned, and it is only the products of the harvest, as
well as those in communal storage, that are distributed. This most
primitive type of village community survived only in a few districts of
northern India, its inhabitants largely confined to a few branches
(_putti_) of the old gens. Kovalevsky sees in this, by analogy with the
_zadruga_ of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the product of a dissolution of the
original blood relationship, which as a result of the growth of the
population, broke up into a number of large families that withdrew from
the community with their lands. In the middle of the previous century
there were still a considerable number of village communities of this
type, some of them with more than 150 members, while others boasted 400.
More predominant, however, was the small village community, which came
together in larger kinship groups on the area of the old gens only in
exceptional cases, i.e. in connection with the sale of land. As a
general rule, they led the isolated and strictly regulated existence
that Marx, using English sources, portrays in a few short passages in
_Capital_:

>These small and extremely ancient Indian communities, for example, some
>of which continue to exist to this day, are based on the possession of
>the land in common, on the blending of agriculture and handicrafts and
>on an unalterable division of labor, which serves as a fixed plan and
>basis for action whenever a new community is started. The communities
>occupy areas of from a hundred up to several thousand acres, and each
>forms a compact whole producing all it requires. Most of the products
>are destined for direct use by the community itself, and are not
>commodities. Hence production here is independent of that division of
>labor brought about in Indian society as a whole by the exchange of
>commodities. It is the surplus alone that becomes a commodity, and a
>part of that surplus cannot become a commodity until it has reached the
>hands of the state, because from time immemorial a certain quantity of
>the community's production has found its way to the state as rent in
>kind. The form of the community varies in different parts of India. In
>the simplest communities, the land is tilled in common, and the produce
>is divided among the members. At the same time, spinning and weaving
>are carried on in each family as subsidiary industries. Alongside the
>mass of people thus occupied in the same way, we find the "_chief
>inhabitant_," who is judge, police authority and tax-gatherer in one;
>the _book-keeper_, who keeps the accounts of the tillage and registers
>everything relating to this; another official, who prosecutes
>criminals, protects strangers traveling through and escorts them to the
>next village; the _boundary_ man, who guards the boundaries against
>neighboring communities; the _water-overseer_, who distributes the
>water from the common tasks for irrigation; the _Brahmin_, who conducts
>the religious services; the _schoolmaster_, who on the sand teaches the
>children reading and writing; the _calendar Brahmin_, or astrologer,
>who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seed-time and harvest,
>and for every other kind of agricultural work; a _smith_ and a
>_carpenter_, who make and repair all the agricultural implements; the
>_potter_, who makes all the pottery of the village; the _barber_, the
>_washerman_, who washes clothes, the _silversmith_, here and there the
>_poet_, who in some communities replaces the silversmith, in others the
>schoolmaster. This dozen or so of individuals is maintained at the
>expense of the whole community. If the population increases, a new
>community is founded, on the pattern of the old one, on unoccupied land
>... The law that regulates the division of labor in the community acts
>with the irresistible authority of a law of nature ... The simplicity
>of the productive organism in these self-sufficing communities which
>constantly reproduce themselves in the same form and, when accidentally

>this simplicity supplies the key to the riddle of the _unchangeability_
>of Asiatic _societies_, which is in such striking contrast with the

>up in the cloudy regions of politics.

2: At the time of the English conquest, the original tribal community
had in most cases already been dissolved. From its dissolution, however,
emerged a new form, a kinship community with partitioned agricultural
land, though not equally divided. The unequal lots of land were given to
individual families and their size was based on the family's
relationship to the tribal ancestors. This form was prevalent in
northwestern India as well as in Punjab. The lots here were neither held
for life nor were they hereditary; they remained in the family's
possession until such time as the growth of the population or the need
to allocate a lot to a relative who had been temporarily absent made a
repartitioning necessary. Frequently, however, new claims were satisfied
not by a general repartitioning, but by allocating new parcels of
uncultivated communal land. In this way, the familial lots of land were
often -- in fact, if not in law -- theirs for life, and even
inheritable. Alongside this unevenly partitioned communal land, forests,
marshes, fields, and uncultivated land still belonged in common to all
the families, who likewise utilized them collectively. This unusual
communistic organization based on inequality came into contradiction
with new interests. With each new generation, determining the degree of
kinship became more difficult, the tradition of blood ties faded, and
the inequality of the familial lots of land was increasingly felt as an
injustice by those disadvantaged by it. In many regions, on the other
hand, a mixing of the population unavoidably took place, whether because
of the departure of some of the kinship group, because of war and
extermination of another part of the population, or because of the
settlement and acceptance of new arrivals. Thus, the population of the
community, despite all the apparent immobility and immutability of their
conditions, was indeed subdivided according to the quality of the soil
into fields (_wund_), each family receiving a few strips of land both in
the better, irrigated fields (which were called _sholgura_ from _shola_,
or rice) and in the inferior ones (_culmee_). Reallocations were not
originally periodic, at least before the English conquest, but took
place each time population growth caused a real inequality in the
economic situation of the families. This was especially true in
communities rich in land, which had a supply of utilizable fields. In
smaller communities, repartitioning occurred every ten, eight or five
years, often every year. This was particularly the case where there was
a lack of good fields, making equal distribution each year to all
members of the mark impossible, so that only by rotating the use of the
various fields could an equitable balance be achieved. Thus, the Indian
tribal community ends, as it is disintegrating, by assuming the form
that is historically established as the original German mark community.

With British India and Algeria, we see two classic examples of the
desperate struggle and the tragic end of the ancient communist economic
organization through contact with European capitalism. The picture of
the changeable fate of the mark community would not be complete if we
failed to take into consideration the remarkable example of a country
where history apparently took an entirely different course. In this
case, the state did not seek to destroy the communal property of the
peasants through force, but on the contrary, attempted to rescue and
preserve it with all the means at its disposal. This country is tsarist
Russia.

We do not need to concern ourselves here with the enormous theoretical
debate on the origins of the Russian peasant commune that has gone on
for decades. It was only natural, in complete accord with the general
hostile attitude toward primitive communism among contemporary bourgeois
scholarship, that the "discovery" by the Russian Professor [Boris]
Chicherin in 1858, according to whom the agricultural commune in Russia
was not an original historical product at all, but supposedly an
artificial product of the fiscal policy of tsarism, should have achieved
such a favorable reception and acceptance among German scholars.
Chicherin, who yet again provides proof that liberal scholars are, as
historians, for the most part much more ineffectual than their
reactionary colleagues, still accepts the theory, which has already been
definitively abandoned for Western Europe since Maurer, that the
Russians settled in individual settlements from which communes
developed, supposedly only in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
In this connection, Chicherin derives collective farming and the
imposition of plots of land from the crop rotation of strips of the
common land, collective ownership of the land likewise from boundary
disputes, and the public power of the mark community from the collective
burden of the poll tax introduced in the sixteenth century. Thus, in a
typically liberal fashion, he more or less turns all historical
contexts, causes and consequences upside down.

Whatever one thinks about the antiquity of the peasant agricultural
commune and its origins, it has, in any case, outlived the whole long
history of serfdom as well as its dissolution, through to most recent
times. We shall deal here only with its fate in the nineteenth century.

When Tsar Alexander II enacted his so-called "emancipation" of the
peasants, their own land was sold to them by the lords -- following
completely the Prussian example -- with the latter being well
indemnified by the treasury in bonds for the worst areas of the land
they allegedly owned, imposing a debt of 900 million rubles, to be
repaid at an annual rate of 6 percent within forty-nine years. This land
was not, as in Prussia, assigned to individual peasant families as
private property, but to whole communities as inalienable and
unmortgageable communal property. The entire community took joint
responsibility for the debt repayment, just as they had for the various
taxes and dues, and had a free hand in assessing the shares of its
individual members. This was the arrangement made for the entire massive
area of the Great Russian peasantry. In the early 1890s, the
distribution of landownership in European Russia (leaving out Poland,
Finland, and the region of the Don Cossacks) was as follows: public
domains, consisting mostly of enormous forest regions in the north and
of wastelands, encompassed 150 million _dessiatines_; imperial
appanages, 7 million; church and municipal property, somewhat less than
9 million; in private ownership, 93 million (only 5 percent of this
belonging to the peasants, the rest to the aristocracy), while 131
million _dessiatines_ were communal peasant property. As late as 1900,
there were 122 million hectares of communal peasant property, against
only 22 million that were the property of individual peasants.

Looking at the economy of the Russian peasantry in this enormous area,
as it existed until recently and in part still exists today, it is again
easy to recognize the typical structures of the mark community, as these
existed in Germany and Africa, on the Ganges and in Peru. The mark's
fields were partitioned, while forests, grasslands and bodies of water
were undivided communal land. With the general prevalence of the
primitive three-field crop rotation, summer and winter fields were
divided according to soil quality into strips ("charts"), and each strip
into smaller segments. The summer strips were distributed in April and
the winter ones in June. With scrupulous observation of equal land
distribution, the diversity of crops had become so developed that in the
Moscow province, for example, there were in both the summer and winter
fields an average of eleven strips each, so that each peasant had at
least twenty-two scattered parcels of land to cultivate. The community
usually reserved plots of land for emergency communal purposes, or laid
up stocks for the same purpose, to which each individual member had to
supply grain. The technical progress of the economy was ensured by each
peasant family being able to keep their land for ten years on condition
that they fertilized it, or each field being divided from the start into
parcels of land that were fertilized from the outset and only
repartitioned every ten years. Most of the flax fields and the fruit and
vegetable gardens were subject to the same rule.

The allocation of various meadows and pastures for the community herds,
the marking of herds, the fencing of meadows and the protection of
fields, as well as decisions over system of rotation, the time for
particular field work, and the date and method of repartitioning -- all
of this was a matter for the community, or more specifically, the
village assembly. As far as the frequency of repartitioning was
concerned, there was great diversity. In one particular province, for
example, Saratov, nearly half of the 278 village communities studied in
1877 undertook a reallotment each year, while the remainder did this
every two, three, five, six, eight or eleven years. At the same time,
thirty-eight communities that practiced collective fertilization had
given up repartitioning altogether.

What is most remarkable about the Russian mark community is the method
of land apportionment. The principle of equal lots common among the
Germans was not prevalent in the Russian case, nor was a determination
based on the needs of the particular family, as in Peru. Instead, the
principle of taxability was the single determining factor. The
government's concern with taxation continued to dominate the life of the
commune after the peasants' "emancipation," and all the village
institutions revolved around taxation. For the tsarist government,
taxation was based on the so-called "audited souls," that is, all the
male inhabitants of the community without distinction of age, as
determined every twenty years, since the first peasant census under
Peter the Great, by the famous "audits" that were the terror of the
Russian people and tore whole communities apart.

The government taxed the villages on the basis of the number of audited
"souls." Yet the commune allocated the total amount of tax for which it
was liable on peasant households according to their number of workers,
and it was the tax capacity measured in this way that determined each
household's portion of land. Rather than a basis of sustenance for the
peasants, land allocation in Russia after 1861 was a basis of taxation.
It was not a benefit to which each household was entitled, but an
obligation imposed on every member of the commune as a state service.
There was nothing more strange than the Russian village assembly for the
partitioning of land. From all sides could be heard protests against the
allocation of too large parcels of land -- poor families with no real
workers, made up predominantly of women or children, were generally
spared from being allocated a parcel of land, on grounds of
"powerlessness," while larger allotments were forced on wealthy peasants
by the mass of poorer peasants. The tax burden that is so central to
Russian village life is also enormous. On top of the debt repayments,
there were also poll taxes, a village tax, church tax, salt tax, etc. In
the 1880s, the poll tax and salt tax were abolished, yet the tax burden
remained so enormous that it devoured all of the peasantry's economic
resources. According to a statistic from the 1890s, 70 percent of the
peasantry drew less than a minimum existence from their land allotments,
20 percent were able to feed themselves, but not to keep livestock,
while only 9 percent had a surplus above their own needs that could be
taken to market. Tax arrears were therefore a frequent phenomenon of the
Russian village from the "emancipation" onwards. Already in the 1870s,
an average yearly intake of fifty million rubles from the poll tax was
accompanied by an annual deficit of eleven million rubles. After the
poll tax was lifted, the poverty of the Russian village continued to
grow, due to the simultaneous escalation of indirect taxation from the
eighties onward. In 1904, the tax arrears amounted to 127 million
rubles, a debt that was almost completely cancelled because collecting
it had become totally impossible and because of the general
revolutionary ferment. The taxes not only ate up all of the peasants'
income, they also forced them to seek side occupations. One of these was
seasonal farm labor, which brought whole migrations of peoples into the
Russian hinterland, the strongest male villagers moving to the large
aristocratic estates to be hired as day laborers, while their own fields
back home were left in the weaker hands of older, female, and adolescent
workers. The beckoning of the city with its manufacturing industries
offered another possibility. In the central industrial region,
therefore, a class of temporary workers formed who moved to the city
only for the winter, mostly to textile factories, returning to their
villages with their earnings in the spring to work in the fields.
Finally, in many districts, there was industrial domestic work or
occasional agricultural work on the side, such as transport or chopping
wood. And even with all of this, the large majority of the peasant
masses could hardly support themselves. Not only was the whole
agricultural yield swallowed by taxation, but their extra earnings as
well. The mark community, which was collectively liable for the taxes,
was equipped with strong means of enforcement vis-à-vis its members. It
could hire out those in arrears with their taxes for wage labor, and
requisition their earned income. It issued or refused internal passports
to its members, without which a peasant was unable to leave the village.
Finally, it had the legal right to inflict corporal punishment on those
whose taxes were intractably in arrears. Periodically, this made the
Russian village in the enormous stretches of the Russian interior a
horrific sight. Upon the arrival of the tax collectors, a procedure
began for which tsarist Russia coined the term "flogging out those in
arrears." The entire village assembly appeared, the "evaders" had to
take off their trousers and lay down on a bench, whereupon they were
brutally beaten with a birch by their fellow mark members, one after the
other. The moaning and weeping of those being thrashed -- most often
bearded family fathers, even white-haired old men -- accompanied the
higher authorities, who, after they had completed their task with the
ringing of bells, went off in their troikas to hunt in another community
and carry out the same punishments. It was not uncommon for a peasant to
spare himself this public punishment by committing suicide. Another
unique product of those circumstances was the "tax beggar," an
impoverished old peasant who took to begging as a tramp in order to
cobble together the taxes due and bring them back to the village. The
state watched over the mark community, which had been turned into a tax
machine, with severity and persistence. A law of 1881, for example,
decreed that the community could only sell agricultural land if
two-thirds of the peasants made that decision, after which it was still
necessary to get the consent of the ministry of the interior, the
ministry of finance, and the ministry of crown lands. Individual
peasants were allowed to sell their inherited lands only to other
members of the mark community. Taking on a mortgage was forbidden. Under
Alexander III, the village community was robbed of all autonomy and
placed under the thumb of "land captains," an institution similar to the
Prussian district administrators. Decisions made by the village assembly
required the consent of these officials; repartitionings of land were
undertaken under their supervision, as were tax assessment and debt
collection. The law of 1893 made a partial concession to time pressure
by declaring repartitionings permissible only every twelve years. Yet,
at the same time, withdrawing from the mark community required the
consent of the community and was allowed only on condition that the
person involved contributed his individual portion of the repayment debt
in full.

Despite all of these artificial legal binds that squeezed the village
community, despite the guardianship of three ministries and a swarm of
_chinovniks_ [petty officials], the dissolution of the mark community
could no longer be prevented. There was the crushing tax burden; the
deterioration of the peasant economy as a result of the side activities
in agricultural and industrial work; a shortage of land, especially
pasture and forest, which had already been grabbed by the aristocracy at
the time of emancipation, and a shortage of arable fields due to
increasing population. All of this had two critical effects: the flight
to the city and the rise of usury within the village. To the extent that
the combination of peasant farming and outside work in industry or
elsewhere increasingly served only to pay the tax burden, without ever
providing a real subsistence, membership in the mark community became
like an iron chain of hunger around the necks of the peasants. The
natural desire of the poorer members of the community was to escape from
this chain. Hundreds of fugitives were returned by the police to their
communities as undocumented vagabonds, then made an example of by being
beaten on a bench with rods by their mark comrades. But even the rods
and the enforcement of passport controls proved powerless against the
mass flight of the peasants, who fled from the hell of their "village
communism" to the city under cover of darkness, to plunge definitively
into the sea of the industrial proletariat. Others, for whom family
bonds or other circumstances made escape inadvisable, sought to
accomplish their exit from the agricultural commune by legal means. To
achieve this, they had to contribute their share of the debt repayment,
and were assisted here by moneylenders. Early on, not only the tax
burden but the forced sale of grain on the most unacceptable terms in
order to repay these debts exposed the Russian peasant to usurers. Every
emergency, every bad crop made resort to them unavoidable. And
ultimately, even emancipation from the yoke of the community was
unattainable for most unless they put themselves under the new yoke of
the usurer, paying dues and other services for an incalculable length of
time. While the impoverished peasants sought to flee the mark community
in order to free themselves from misery, many wealthy peasants simply
turned their backs on it and left the commune in order to escape
responsibility for the taxes of the poor. But even where there was less
official departure of wealthy peasants, these individuals, who were in
large part also the village usurers, formed a ruling power over the
peasant masses, and knew how to extract decisions convenient to
themselves from the indebted, dependent majority. Thus, in the womb of a
village community officially based on equality and communal property,
there grew a clear division of classes into a small but influential
village bourgeoisie and a mass of dependent and effectively
proletarianized peasants. The internal breakup of the village commune --
crushed by taxes, eaten by usurers, and internally divided -- eventually
made waves outside as well: famine and peasant revolts were frequent
occurrences in Russia in the 1880s, being put down by the provincial
administrations with the same implacability as the tax executors and the
military showed when coming to "pacify" the village. In many regions,
Russian fields became the scene of horrific death by starvation and
bloody turmoil. The Russian _muzhik_ [peasant] experienced the fate of
the Indian peasant, and Orissa here is Saratov, Samara, and so on down
the Volga. When the revolution of the urban proletariat finally broke
out in Russia in 1904 and 1905, the peasant insurrections, which had
been chaotic up to that point, became a political factor by their sheer
weight, tipping the scales of revolution and making the agricultural
question a central issue. Now, as the peasants poured over the
aristocratic estates like an irresistible flood, setting the
"aristocrats' nests" on fire with their cry for land, while the workers'
party formulated the distress of the peasantry into a revolutionary
demand to expropriate state property and the landed estates without
compensation and to place them into the hands of the peasants, tsarism
finally retreated from the centuries-old agrarian policies that it had
pursued with such iron persistence. The mark community could no longer
be resuscitated; it had to be abandoned. Already in 1902, the axe was
taken to the very roots of the village community in its specific Russian
incarnation, with the abolition of collective liability for taxes. Of
course, this measure was actively prepared by the financial policies of
tsarism itself. The treasury could easily forgo collective liability
when it came to direct taxation, now that indirect taxation had reached
such a level that in the budget of 1906, for example, out of a total
revenue of 2,030 million rubles, only 148 million came from direct taxes
and 1,100 million from indirect taxes, including 558 million from the
spirits monopoly alone, a tax that was implemented by the "liberal"
minister, Count Witte, to combat drunkenness. The poverty, hopelessness,
and ignorance of the peasants offered the most reliable form of
collective liability for punctual payment of _this_ tax. In 1905 and
1906, the remaining debt in repayment for emancipation was halved, and
it was cancelled altogether in 1907. The "agrarian reform" implemented
in 1907 then had the avowed aim of creating private peasant property.
The means for this were to come from the parceling of domains,
appanages, and, in part, landed estates. Thus, the proletarian
revolution of the twentieth century, even in its first, incomplete
phase, had already destroyed, at the same time, the last remainders of
bondage and the mark community, which had been artificially preserved by
tsarism.

With the Russian village commune, the varied fate of primitive agrarian
communism comes to an end; the circle is closed. Beginning as a natural
product of social development, as the best guarantee of economic
progress, and of the material and intellectual flourishing of society,
the mark community ends here as an abused tool of political and economic
backwardness. The Russian peasant, who is beaten with rods by his fellow
community members in the service of tsarist absolutism, offers the most
horrific historical critique of the limits of primitive communism and
the most evident expression of the fact that even this social form is
subject to the dialectical law that reason becomes unreason, a benefit
becomes a scourge.

Two facts spring to mind on close contemplation of the fate of the mark
community in various countries and continents. Far from being a rigid,
unchangeable pattern, this highest and final form of the primitive
communist economic system displays above all endless diversity,
flexibility and adaptability, as seen in its various forms. In each
context, and under all circumstances, it undergoes a silent process of
transformation, which, because of its slow pace, may be hardly apparent
at first from the outside. Inside the society, however, new forms are
always replacing old ones and it accordingly survives under any
political superstructure of native or foreign institutions, its economic
and social life constantly developing and decaying, advancing and
declining.

At the same time, this social form shows an extraordinary tenacity and
stability precisely because of its elasticity and adaptability. It
defies all the storms of political history; or rather it tolerates them
passively, lets them pass and patiently endures for centuries the
strains of every form of conquest, foreign rule, despotism and
exploitation. There is only one contact that it cannot tolerate or
overcome -- contact with European civilization, i.e. with capitalism.
This encounter is deadly for the old society, universally and without
exception, and it accomplishes what millennia and the most savage
Oriental conquerors could not: the dissolution of the whole social
structure from the inside, tearing apart all traditional bonds and
transforming the society in a short period of time into a shapeless pile
of rubble.

But this deadly breeze from European capitalism is simply the last and
not the sole factor that brings about the inevitable decline of
primitive society. The seeds of this lie within the society itself. If
we take the various paths of its decline together, those that we know
from a number of examples, this establishes a certain historical order
of succession. Communist ownership of the means of production, as the
basis of a rigorously organized economy, offered the most productive
social labor process and the best material assurance of its continuity
and development for many epochs. But even the progress in labor
productivity that it secured, albeit slowly, necessarily came into
conflict with the communistic organization over time. After the decisive
progress to a higher form of agriculture, with the use of the
ploughshare, had been accomplished and the mark community had retained
its solid form on this basis, the next step in the development of the
technology of production after a certain amount of time necessitated a
more _intensive_ land cultivation, which could only be achieved at that
stage of agricultural technology by more intensive smallholding and by a
stronger and closer relationship of the individual laborer to the soil.
Longer use of the same parcel of land by a single peasant family became
the precondition for its more careful treatment. In both Germany and
Russia, fertilization of the soil led to the gradual abandonment of land
repartitioning. In general, we can identify a trait that is constant
everywhere in the life of the mark community: the movement toward
increasingly long intervals between land reallotments, universally
leading sooner or later to a transition from allotted land to inherited
land. In the same way that the transformation of communal property into
private property keeps pace with the intensification of labor, it is
noticeable that forest and pasture remained communal the longest, while
intensively worked farmland led first to the partitioned mark and then
to hereditary property. Establishing private property in parcels of
arable land does not completely abolish the entire communal economic
organization, which continues to be upheld by crop rotation and enforced
in forest and pastoral communities. The economic and social equality at
the heart of ancient society are still not destroyed by it either.
Initially forms what comes into being is a mass of small peasants, equal
in their living conditions, who can generally continue to work and live
for centuries according to their old traditions. Yet the inheritability
of property certainly opens the gates to future inequality, by the
heritability of holdings and the primogeniture or other settlements that
follow from this, subsequently by their salability or general
alienability.

The undermining of the traditional social organization by the processes
referred to above proceeds extremely slowly. There are other historical
factors at work that accomplish this more quickly and thoroughly, in
particular large-scale public works projects, which the mark community
with its narrow limits is unable to tackle by its very nature. We have
already seen the critical importance that artificial irrigation has for
agriculture in the Orient. The great intensification of labor and
powerful rise in productivity here led to quite different far-reaching
results than the changeover to fertilization in the West. From the
outset, artificial irrigation work is a mass work and a large-scale
undertaking. Precisely because of this, there is no suitable institution
for it within the organization of the mark community, so that special
institutions standing above this had to be created. We know that the
direction of public waterworks lay at the root of the domination by the
priests and every Oriental power. But also in the West, and more
generally, there are various public matters that, though simple in
comparison to contemporary state organization, had nevertheless to be
seen to in every primitive society. These grew with the development and
progress of the society, therefore eventually requiring special organs.
On all sides -- from Germany to Peru, from India to Algeria -- we can
define the path of development as the tendency in primitive societies to
transform elected public offices to inherited ones.

Initially, however, this turnaround, proceeding slowly and
imperceptibly, is still not a break with the foundations of communistic
society. Rather, the inheritability of these public offices is a natural
result of the fact that here too, by the very nature of primitive
societies, collective experience, tradition and personal, ensures the
successful handling of such offices. Over time, however, the
inheritability of the offices leads unavoidably to the creation of a
small local aristocracy, former servants of the community becoming its
rulers. The undivided mark lands, the _ager publicus_ of the Romans, to
which power adhered, served as the economic basis for advancing the
status of this aristocracy. Theft of the undemarcated or unused lands of
the mark is the common method of all indigenous and foreign rulers, who
vault above the peasant masses and subjugate them politically. If the
people in question are isolated from the major centers of civilization,
the aristocracy may not distinguish itself very greatly in its lifestyle
from that of the masses, and may still directly take part in the
production process, while a certain democratic simplicity of customs
covers up differences in wealth. This is the case with the tribal
aristocracy of the Yakut people, which is merely endowed with more
livestock than the ordinary people, and more influence in public
affairs. Following an encounter with more civilized peoples, however,
and vigorous trade, refined taste and relief from labor are soon added
to the privileges of the aristocracy, and a true class differentiation
takes place in society. The most typical example is Greece in the
post-Homeric period.

Thus the division of labor at the heart of primitive society unavoidably
leads, sooner or later, to the breakup of political and economic
equality from inside. One public undertaking, however, plays an
important role in this process and accomplishes the work more
aggressively than do public offices of a peaceful nature. This is
warfare. It is originally a mass affair of the society in question,
subsequently turned, in the wake of advances in production, into the
speciality of certain circles within primitive society in question. The
more advanced, continuous and systematic the labor process of the
society, the less it tolerates the irregularities and the drain of time
and energy resulting from war. If occasional military campaigns are a
direct result of the economic system of hunting and nomadic herding,
agriculture goes together with a great peacefulness and passivity among
the mass of society, so that a special caste of warriors is often needed
for protection. In one way or another, the existence of war, itself just
an expression of the limits of labor productivity, plays an important
role for all primitive peoples and universally leads over time to a new
form of division of labor. The separation of a military aristocracy or
military leadership is the hardest blow that the social equality of the
primitive society must endure. This is why, wherever we learn of
primitive societies, either as survivals from past history or still
existing today, we almost never come across any longer such free and
equal relations as Morgan was able to convey to us with the
serendipitous example of the Iroquois. On the contrary, inequality and
exploitation are everywhere characteristics of the primitive societies
we encounter, being the product of a long history of disintegration,
whether it is a matter of the ruling castes of the Orient, the tribal
aristocracy of the Yakuts, the "great clansmen" of the Scottish Celts,
the military aristocracy of the Greeks, Romans and migrating Germans, or
lastly, to the petty despots of the African empires.

If we look, for example, at the famous empire of Mwata Kazembe in
south-central Africa, to the east of the Lunda empire, into which the
Portuguese penetrated at the beginning of the nineteenth century, we can
see, right in the heart of Africa, in a region hardly touched by
Europeans, primitive Negro social relations in which there is no longer
much equality or freedom to be found. The 1831 expedition of Major
[José] Monteiro and Captain [António] Gamitto, undertaken from the
Zambezi into the interior for scientific and trading purposes, depicts
this as follows. Initially, the expedition came into the land of the
Marawi, primitive hoe farmers living in small, conical palisade houses
and wearing only a loincloth on their bodies. At the time that Monteiro
and Gamitto traveled through Malawiland, it was under the rule of a
despotic leader who went by the title _nede_. He adjudicated all
disputes in his capital city, Muzenda, and no disputing his decision was
allowed. True to form, he convened a council of elders who were
required, however, to agree with his opinion. The land was divided into
provinces, which were governed by _mambos_, and these were then further
divided into districts that were led by _funos_. All of these titles
were hereditary.

>barbaric ceremonies. All of the wives of the departed are locked up

From here they went uphill into the middle of the empire. The Portuguese
came to

>road about forty-five minutes long that was fenced in on both sides by
>two or three meter-high fences made of interwoven poles so elaborately
>constructed that they looked like walls. In these straw walls there
>were small open doors spaced apart from each other. At the end of the
>road, there was a small square hut open only to the west, in the middle
>of which stood a human figure crudely carved out of wood, seventy
>centimeters tall, on a wooden pedestal. In front of the open side lay a
>heap of more than 300 skulls. Here, the road turned into a large square
>area, at the end of which was a large forest only separated from the
>square by a fence. On the outside of it, on both sides of the gate, was
>a line tied on either side of the gate with thirty skulls strung onto
>it by way of ornamentation ... Following this was the reception at

>consisted of a scarlet conical cap, which was composed of half-meter
>long feathers. Wrapped around his forehead was a diadem made of
>glimmering stone; his neck and shoulders were covered by a kind of
>necklace made of shells, square pieces of mirror, and faux gems. Each
>of his arms was wrapped in a piece of blue cloth, decorated with fur,
>and his forearms also had ornamental strings made of blue stones. A

>Negroes armed with brooms were busy removing every piece of dust from

>court surrounded the ruler. First, guarding his throne were two rows of
>figures, forty centimeters high, in the shape of the upper body of a
>Negro adorned with animal horns, while between these figures sat two
>Negroes who burned aromatic leaves in coal pans. The place of honor was
>occupied by the two main wives, the first dressed more or less like
>Mwata. In the background, the harem of 400 women was assembled, and
>indeed these women were completely naked, apart from the aprons on
>their lower bodies. In addition, there were two hundred black women who
>stood waiting for the slightest command. Inside the quadrangle built by

This is a picture of a society that has moved a long way away from the
original foundations of every primitive community, from equality and
democracy. It should not, however, be a foregone conclusion that under
this kind of political despotism, the relations of the mark community,
the communal ownership of the land or communally organized labor cease
to exist. The Portuguese intruders, who recorded precisely the
superficial rubbish about costume and courtesans, have, like all
Europeans, no eyes, no interest and no frame of reference when it comes
to things that run counter to the European system of private ownership.
In any case, the social inequality and despotism of primitive societies
are completely distinct from the inequality that is common in civilized
societies and transplanted now onto the primitive. The increase in
status of the primitive aristocracy and the despotic power of the
primitive leader are all natural products of this society, like all of
its other conditions of life. They are only another expression of the
helplessness of the society with respect to its natural surroundings and
to its own social relations, a helplessness that appears both in magical
cult practices and in the periodic famines that either partly or
completely starve the despotic leader along with the mass of his
subjects. This rule by an aristocracy and a chief is therefore in
complete harmony with the other material and intellectual aspects of the
society, as is clear from the significant fact that the political power
of the primitive ruler is always closely bound up with the primitive
nature religion, with the cult of the dead, and is sustained by it.

From this standpoint, Mwata Kazembe is the Lunda, whom fourteen wives
follow alive into the grave and who rules over the life and death of his
subjects according to his erratic moods, because he believes himself to
be a magician, this being his people's rock-solid conviction. The
despotic "Prince Kasongo" on the Lomami river who, forty years later,
with great dignity among his noblemen and his people, performed, by way
of greeting the Englishman [Verney Lovett] Cameron, a hopping dance with
his two naked daughters in a woman's skirt braided with monkey skins and
with a filthy handkerchief on his head, is in fact a much less absurd
and insanely comical phenomenon than the ruler "by the grace of God"
over sixty-seven million members of a people who produced the likes of
[Immanuel] Kant, [Hermann von] Helmholtz and [Johann Wolfgang von]
Goethe. And yet even the worst enemy of this ruler could not call him a
magician.

Primitive communist society, through its own internal development, leads
to the formation of inequality and despotism. It has not yet
disappeared; on the contrary, it can persist for many thousands of years
under these primitive conditions. Such societies, however, sooner or
later succumb to foreign occupation and then undergo a more or less
far-reaching social reorganization. Foreign rule by Muslims is of
special historical significance, since it predated European rule in vast
stretches of Asia and Africa. Everywhere that nomadic Islamic peoples --
whether Mongol or Arab -- instituted and secured their foreign rule, a
social process began that Henry Maine and Maksim Kovalevsky called the
_feudalization_ of the land. They did not make the land their own
property, but instead turned their attention to two objectives, the
collection of taxes and the military consolidation of their domination
over the country. Both goals were served by a specific
administrative-military organization, under which the land was divided
into several ethnic groups and given as fiefdoms of a kind to Muslim
officials, who were also tax collectors and military administrators.
Large portions of uncultivated mark lands were utilized for the founding
of military colonies. These institutions, together with the spread of
Islam, implemented a profound change in the general conditions of
existence of primitive societies. Only their economic conditions were
little changed. The foundations and the organization of production
remained the same and persisted for many centuries, despite exploitation
and military pressure. Of course, Muslim rule was not always so
considerate of the living conditions of the natives. For example, the
Arabs on the east coast of Africa operated for centuries from the
Zanzibar sultanate an extensive slave trade in Negroes, which led to
frequent slave raids into the interior of Africa, the depopulation and
destruction of whole African villages, and an escalation of despotic
violence by the native chiefs, who found an enticing business venture in
selling their own subjects or the subjugated members of neighboring
tribes. Yet this transformation in conditions, which had such a profound
effect on the fate of African society, was only accomplished as a
further consequences of European influence: the slave trade in Negroes
developed only after the discoveries and conquests of the Europeans in
the sixteenth century, in order to service the plantations and mines
exploited by the Europeans that were in full bloom in America and Asia.

The intrusion of European civilization was a disaster in every sense for
primitive social relations. The European conquerors are the first who
are not merely after subjugation and economic exploitation, but seize
the very means of production, by ripping the land from under the feet of
the native population. In this way, European capitalism deprives the
primitive social order of its foundation. What emerges is something that
is worse than all oppression and exploitation, total anarchy and that
specifically European phenomenon of the uncertainty of social existence.
The subjugated peoples, separated from their means of production, are
regarded by European capitalism as mere laborers; if they are useful for
this end, they are made into slaves, and if they are not, they are
exterminated. We have witnessed this method in the Spanish, English, and
French colonies. Before the advance of capitalism, the primitive social
order, which outlasted all previous historical phases, capitulates. Its
last remnants are eradicated from the earth and its elements --
labor-power and means of production -- are absorbed by capitalism. Early
communist society fell everywhere, in the last instance, because it was
made obsolete by economic progress, making room for new prospects of
development. This development and progress are represented for a long
time by the base methods of a class society, until this too is made
obsolete and pushed aside by further progress. Here too, violence is
merely the servant of economic development.

## 4. Commodity production

The task we have set ourselves is as follows. A society cannot exist
without common labor, i.e. without labor with a plan and organization.
And we have found various different forms of this, in all eras. In
present-day society we hardly find it at all: neither rule nor law, nor
democracy, no trace of plan and organization -- anarchy. How is
capitalist society possible?

### 4.1

In order to trace the construction of the capitalist tower of Babel, let
us imagine once again a society with a planned organization of labor.
This may be a society with a highly developed division of labor, in
which not only agriculture and industry are separate, but each
particular branch of both has also become the speciality of a particular
group of working people. In this society there are for example
agriculturalists and foresters, fisherfolk and gardeners, shoemakers and
tailors, locksmiths and blacksmiths, spinners and weavers, etc. etc.
This society, taken as a whole, is endowed with every kind of work and
every kind of product. These products are distributed in greater or
lesser amounts to all members of society, as labor is communal; it is
divided and organized from the start in a planned way by some kind of
authority -- whether this is the despotic law of the government, or
serfdom, or any other kind of organization. For simplification, however,
we assume that it is a communist community with communal property, as we
are already familiar with from the Indian example. We only presuppose
for the time being that the division of labor within this community is
far more developed than was historically the case, and assume that one
part of the members of the community devote themselves exclusively to
agriculture, while other kinds of labor are all performed by specialist
artisans. The economy of this community is quite clear to us: it is the
community members themselves who possess the land and the means of
production in common, and their common will also determines what, when
and how much of each product is to be produced. The mass of finished
products, moreover, since these belong equally to all, are distributed
among everyone according to need. Now, however, imagine that one fine
day, in the communist community with this arrangement, common property
ceases to exist, and along with it also common labor and the common will
that regulates this. The highly developed division of labor that has
been attained obviously remains. The shoemaker still sits at his last,
the baker has nothing and knows nothing except his oven, the smith has
only his smithy and only knows how to swing a hammer, etc. etc. But the
chain that formerly connected all these special labors into a common
labor, into the societal economy, is broken. Each person is now on his
own: the farmer, the shoemaker, the baker, the locksmith, the weaver,
etc. Each is completely free and independent. The community no longer
has anything to say to him, no one can order him to work for the whole,
nor does anyone bother about his needs. The community that was
previously a whole has been broken up into individual little particles
or atoms, like a mirror shattered into a thousand splinters; each person
now floats like a piece of dust in the air, as it were, and wonders how
he will manage. What happens now to the community that has been struck
overnight by such a catastrophe? What will all these people left to
their own devices do the next day? One thing is certain right away --
they will carry on working, exactly as they did previously. For as long
as human needs cannot be satisfied without labor, every human society
has to work. Whatever transformations and changes may take place in
society, labor cannot cease for a moment. The former members of the
communist community, therefore, even after the ties between them have
been broken and they are left completely to themselves, will certainly
each carry on working, and since we have assumed that all labor is
already specialized, each of them will continue to pursue only that work
that has become his speciality and for which he has the means of
production: the shoemaker will make boots, the baker will bake bread,
the weaver produce cloth, the farmer grow corn, etc. But a difficulty
now immediately arises. Each of these producers, despite producing
extremely important and immediately needed objects of use -- each of
these specialists, the shoemaker, the baker, the smith, the weaver --
were until yesterday all equally esteemed useful members of society, and
could not get by without society. Each had his important place in the
whole. Now, however, the whole no longer exists, each person exists only
for himself. But none of them can live alone, simply from the products
of their own labor. The shoemaker cannot eat his boots, the baker cannot
satisfy all his needs with bread, and even the farmer with the fullest
barn of corn would die from hunger and cold if he had nothing but corn.
Each person has many needs, and can only satisfy a particular one of
these. Each accordingly needs a certain quantity of the products of all
others. They are all dependent on one another. But how is this to be
managed, since we know that no connections and ties between the
individual producers exist any more? The shoemaker urgently needs bread
from the baker, but has no means of obtaining this bread; he cannot
force the baker to supply him, as both alike are free and independent
people. If he wants to enjoy the proceeds of the baker's labor, this can
evidently be based only on reciprocity, i.e., if he supplies the baker
in turn with a product useful to him. But the baker also needs the
products of the shoemaker, and finds himself in just the same situation
as the latter. This indicates the basis for reciprocity. The shoemaker
gives the baker boots so as to receive bread in return. Shoemaker and
baker exchange their products, and both can now satisfy their needs. It
turns out that, given a highly developed division of labor, a complete
independence of the producers from one another and the absence of any
kind or organization between them, the only way of making the products
of different labors accessible to all is -- _exchange_. The shoemaker,
the baker, the farmer, the spinner, the weaver, the locksmith -- all
reciprocally exchange their products, and in this way satisfy all their
various needs. Exchange creates in this way a new tie between the
fragmented, individualized and separated private producers. Labor and
consumption, the life of the shattered community, can start up again, as
exchange has given them the possibility of once more all working for one
another, it has again made possible social collaboration, social
production, even in the form of fragmented private production.

But this is indeed a quite new and particular form of social
collaboration, and we need to examine it more closely. Each individual
person now works for himself, producing on his own account, on the basis
of his own will and judgment. In order to live, he now has to produce
products that he himself does not need but that others do. Each works
accordingly for others. In itself, this is nothing special and nothing
new. In the communist community, too, everyone works for everyone else.
What is special now, however, is that each person now only hands over
his product to others by way of exchange, and can only obtain the
products of others likewise by exchange. Everyone must now, in order to
obtain the products they need, produce by their own labor products
designed for exchange. The shoemaker must continue to produce boots that
he does not need himself, that are quite useless to him, a waste of
labor. The only use and purpose they have for him is that he can
exchange them against other products that he needs. He therefore
produces his boots already with the purpose of exchange, i.e. he
produces them as a commodity. Each person now can only satisfy his
needs, only obtain products that others have produced, if he himself
appears with a product that others need and that he has produced with
his labor for this purpose; in other words, each obtains his share of
the products of all others, of the social product, by himself appearing
with a commodity. The product that he has made for exchange is now his
right to demand a portion of the total social product. This total social
product may well no longer exist in the earlier form it took in the
communist community, where it directly represented in its mass and
totality the wealth of the community, and was only then distributed.
Everyone there worked in common on the account of the community and
under the leadership of the community, so that what was produced already
came into the world as a social product. The distribution of this total
product to individuals occurred only subsequently, and only then did the
product enter the private use of individual members of the community.
Now things proceed the other way round: each produces on his own account
as a private person, and it is only in exchange that the finished
products together form a sum that can be viewed as social wealth. The
share of each person, in both social labor and social wealth, is now
represented by the special commodity that he has produced with his labor
and brought for exchange with others. The share of each in the total
social labor, therefore, is no longer represented in a certain quantum
of labor that is allocated to him in advance, but rather in the finished
product, in the commodity, that he supplies as he sees fit. If he
doesn't want to work, then he doesn't need to, he can just go out for a
walk and no one will scold him in the street, as did indeed happen with
refractory members of the communist community, where idlers were likely
to be sharply reprimanded by the "chief inhabitant," the head of the
community, or were liable to public contempt at the community assembly.
Now each person is his own unrestricted lord and master, there is no
community authority. But if he does not work, he also receives nothing
in exchange for the products of work. On the other hand, however, today
the individual is not even sure that, no matter how diligently he works,
he will receive the means of subsistence he needs; for no one is
compelled to give him these, even in exchange for his products. Exchange
only comes about if there is a reciprocal need. If no one in the
community needs boots at the moment, the shoemaker may work ever so
diligently, and produce ever such a fine product, without anyone taking
it and giving him bread, meat, etc. in exchange, so that he remains
without what he most needs in order to live. Here again, we see a world
of difference compared with the earlier communist relations in the
community. The community maintained the shoemaker because there was a
general need in the community for boots. He was told by the community
authority how many boots he was to produce, and he worked as it were as
a community servant, a community official, everyone being in exactly
this same position. But if the community kept a shoemaker, it obviously
had to feed him. He received his share from the common wealth just like
everyone else, and this share of his did not stand in any direct
connection with his share in the total work. Of course he had to work,
and he was fed because he worked, because he was a useful member of the
community. But whether he had more or fewer boots to produce this
particular month, even sometimes none at all, he still received the same
means of subsistence, his share of the community's total resources. Now,
however, he only receives to the extent that his work is needed, i.e. to
the extent that his product is accepted by others in exchange, like for
like. Everyone now works just as he wants, how he wants, as much as he
wants, at what he wants. The only confirmation that he has produced the
right things, what society needs, that he has indeed performed socially
necessary labor, is the _fact_ that his product is accepted by others.
Not all labor, therefore, be it ever so diligent and solid, now has a
definite purpose and value in advance from the point of view of society;
only a product that is exchangeable has value; a product that no one
takes in exchange, no matter how solid, is valueless work, work thrown
away.

Now, therefore, each person, in order to participate in the fruits of
social production, must also participate in social labor, must produce
commodities. But the fact that his labor actually is recognized as
socially necessary labor is not something anyone tells him, but rather
something he learns from his commodity being taken in exchange, being
exchangeable. His share in the labor and product of the whole is thus
only assured by his product's receiving the seal of socially necessary
labor, the seal of exchange-value. If his product remains
unexchangeable, he has then created a worthless product, and his labor
was socially superfluous. Then he is only a private shoemaker, cutting
leather and cobbling boots for his own amusement, standing outside
society, as it were, for society has no interest in his product, and so
the products of society are unavailable to him. If today our shoemaker
has been fortunate enough to make an exchange, and obtained means of
subsistence in return, he can not only eat his fill and be properly
clothed, but also pride himself on his way home that he has been
recognized as a useful member of society, his labor recognized as
necessary labor. If on the other hand he returns home with his boots, as
no one wanted to relieve him of them, he has every reason to be
melancholy, as he not only remains without soup, but on top of this it
has more or less been explained to him, if only with a chilly silence:
Society has no need of you, my friend, your labor was just not
necessary, you are a superfluous person and can happily go and hang
yourself. A pair of exchangeable boots, or more generally, a commodity
with exchange-value, is thus all that is needed each time for our
shoemaker to be a member of society. But the baker, the weaver and the
farmer -- everyone -- also find themselves in the same position as our
shoemaker. The society that sometimes recognizes the shoemaker, and
sometimes rejects him with coldness and disdain, is no more than the sum
of all these individual commodity producers who work for reciprocal
exchange. The sum of social labor and social product that comes into
being in this way is therefore not at all the same as the sum of all the
labor and products of individual members, as was earlier the case in the
communistic, communal economy. For now certain individuals can work
diligently, yet their product, if it finds no one to take it in
exchange, is something to be thrown away and does not count at all. Only
exchange determines what were necessary labors and necessary products,
those that count socially. It is the same as if everyone initially
worked blindly at home, in any way they chose, then brought their
finished products to a place where they were inspected and received a
stamp: these labors were socially necessary and are accepted in
exchange, but those ones were not necessary and so are completely
worthless. The stamp says: these ones have value, those are worthless
and remain private pleasures -- or sufferings -- of the people
concerned.

If we summarize the various aspects, it turns out that, by the mere fact
of commodity exchange, without any other ingredient or regulation, three
important relationships are determined:

1: The _share_ of each member of society in social _labor_. This share,
in kind and measure, is no longer allocated to him in advance by the
community, but only post festum, depending on whether the finished
product is accepted or not. Previously, each individual pair of boots
that our shoemaker produced was immediately and in advance social labor,
even when still on the last. Now his boots are initially private labor,
and no one else's concern. Only subsequently are they viewed on the
market, and only to the extent that they are taken in exchange is the
labor spent by the shoemaker acknowledged as social labor. Otherwise
they remain his private labor and are valueless.

2: The _share_ of each member in social _wealth_. Previously, the
shoemaker received his share of the community's finished products by way
of a distribution. This share was assessed, firstly according to the
general prosperity of the community, its level of wealth at this
particular time, and secondly according to the needs of the members. A
numerous family necessarily received more than a less numerous one. With
the partitioning of conquered lands among the Germanic tribes, who
arrived in Europe in the era of the great migrations and settled on the
ruins of the Roman Empire, family size also played a role. The Russian
commune, which still carried out redistributions of its common property
here and there in the 1880s, took into consideration the number of
"mouths" in each household. Under the general rule of exchange, however,
any relationship between the need of a member of society and his share
in wealth disappears, as does any relationship between this share and
the size of the society's total wealth. Now, only the product that each
member offers on the commodity market decides his share in the social
wealth, and only in so far as it is accepted in exchange as socially
necessary.

3: Finally, the _social division of labor_ is itself regulated by
exchange. Previously, the community decided that it needed so and so
many farm workers, so and so many shoemakers, bakers, locksmiths and
blacksmiths, etc. The correct proportion between the different trades
was the responsibility of the community and its chosen officials, as it
also was to make sure that all branches of labor needed were practised.
They were certainly familiar with the famous case in which the
representatives of a village community asked that a locksmith condemned
to death should be reprieved and a blacksmith hanged instead, as there
were two blacksmiths in the village. This is a striking example of
public concern for the proper division of labor in a community. (We saw,
moreover, how in the Middle Ages, Charlemagne expressly prescribed the
kinds of artisans for his estates, and their numbers. We also saw how in
medieval towns the guild regulations made sure that particular trades
were practiced in the right proportions, and artisans whom it lacked
were invited in from elsewhere.) With free and unrestricted exchange,
this matter is settled by exchange itself. Now no one tells our
shoemaker to work. If he wants, he can produce soap bubbles or paper
dragons. He can also, if he likes, abandon shoemaking for weaving,
spinning, or goldsmith's work. No one tells him that society needs him
in general, and needs him as a cobbler in particular. Naturally, society
does have a general need for shoemaking. But no one now decides how many
shoemakers will meet this need. No one tells this particular shoemaker
whether he is necessary or not, whether it is not rather a weaver or a
smith who is needed. But what he is not told, he learns once more simply
and solely on the commodity market. If his shoes are accepted in
exchange, he knows that society needs him as a shoemaker. And
conversely. He can produce the best commodity, but if other shoemakers
have sufficiently met the demand, his commodity is superfluous. If this
happens repeatedly, he has to abandon his trade. The redundant shoemaker
is expelled from society in the same mechanical way as superfluous
material is expelled from the animal body. Since his work is not
accepted as social labor, he is en route to extinction. The same
compulsion to produce exchangeable products for others as one's own
condition of existence will eventually lead our expelled shoemaker into
another trade, where there is a stronger and insufficiently met demand,
for example weaving or haulage, and in this way the shortage of workers
here is filled. But not only is a correct proportion maintained in this
way between different trades, entire trades are abolished and new ones
created. If a certain social need ceases or is met by other products
than previously, this is not decided by the members, as in earlier
communist communities, and workers accordingly withdrawn from one trade
and moved into another. It happens simply by the unexchangeability of
the obsolete product. In the seventeenth century, wig making was still
an essential trade in every town. But after fashions changed, and people
stopped wearing wigs, this trade died a natural death, simply by the
unsalability of wigs. With the development of modern urban water supply,
and pipes taking water mechanically to each dwelling, the profession of
water-carrier -- _Wasserer_ as it was known in Vienna -- generally
disappeared.

We can now take an opposite case. Let us assume that our shoemaker, made
to feel socially unnecessary in no uncertain terms by the systematic
spurning of his commodity, imagines that he is despite this an
indispensable member of humanity and still wants to live. In order to
live, he must, as we know and he knows, produce commodities. And he now
invents a new product, let us say a beard-cover or a wonderful boot-wax.
Does this mean he has created a new socially necessary branch of labor,
or will he remain unrecognized, like so many great inventors of genius?
Again, no one tells him, and he learns this only on the commodity
market. If his new product is accepted for long enough in exchange, then
this new branch of production has been recognized as socially necessary,
and the social division of labor has experienced a new expansion.

You see how in our community, which, following the collapse of the
communistic regime and common property, the disappearance of any kind of
authority in economic life, any organization and planning in labor, any
kind of connection among the individual members, initially seemed quite
hopeless in the wake of this catastrophe, we gradually see the rise
again of a certain connection, a certain order, and how this happens in
a completely mechanical way. Without any understanding among the
individual members, without the intervention of any higher power, the
individual fragments form up into a whole, as best they can. Exchange
itself now regulates the whole economy mechanically, just like a kind of
pump mechanism: it creates a link between the individual producers, it
forces them to work, it governs their division of labor, determines
their wealth and its distribution. Exchange governs society. It is of
course a somewhat strange order that has now arisen before our eyes.
Society now looks completely different from how it did previously under
the regime of the communist community. At that time it was a compact
whole, a kind of big family, whose members had all grown up together and
stuck closely together, a firm organism, even perhaps an ossified one,
rather immovable and rigid. Now we have an extremely loose structure, in
which the individual members keep falling away and then reassembling. We
have seen, in fact, how no one tells our shoemaker _that_ he should
work, _what_ he should work at, or _how much_ he should work. On the
other hand, no one asks him whether he needs sustenance, what he needs,
or how much he needs. No one bothers about him, he does not exist for
society. He only informs society of his existence by the fact that he
appears on the commodity market with a product of his labor. If his
commodity is accepted, then so too is his existence. His labor is
acknowledged as socially necessary, and himself thereby acknowledged as
its representative, only in so far as his boots are taken in exchange.
He obtains means of subsistence from the social wealth only in so far as
his boots are accepted as a commodity. He becomes a member of the
society only in so far as he produces exchangeable products,
commodities, and only so long as he has these and can dispose of them.
Each exchangeable pair of boots makes him a member of society, and each
unsalable pair excludes him once again from society. Thus the shoemaker
has no connection with society as a human being, only his boots allow
him to adhere to society, and they do so only in so far as they have
exchange value, are saleable as a commodity. This is therefore not a
permanent membership, but one that keeps on being dissolved and renewed.
But as well as our shoemaker, all other commodity producers are in the
same situation. And there is no one in this society but commodity
producers, for it is only in exchange that one receives the means to
live; in order to receive these, each person must therefore appear with
commodities. Commodity production is the condition of life, and a state
of society thereby comes into being in which people all lead their
particular existence as completely separate individuals, who do not
exist for each other, but only through their commodities attain a
constantly fluctuating membership of the whole, or are again excluded
from membership. This is an extremely loose and mobile society, caught
up in the ceaseless whirl of its individual members.

We see that the abolition of a planned economy and the introduction of
exchange brought about a complete transformation in people's social
relations, turning society around from top to bottom.

### 4.2

There are great difficulties, however, with exchange being the only
economic tie between the members of society, since exchange does not run
as smoothly as we have just assumed. Let us look at the matter more
closely.

So long as we only considered exchange between our two individual
producers, the shoemaker and the baker, things were quite simple. The
shoemaker cannot live from boots alone, and needs bread; the baker
cannot live from bread alone, just like the Bible says, though what he
needs in this case is not the word of God, but rather boots. Since there
is complete reciprocity here, exchange happens easily: the bread moves
from the hands of the baker, who doesn't need it, into those of the
shoemaker; the boots move from the shoemaker's workshop into the bakery.
Both have their needs satisfied, and both private labors have been
confirmed as socially necessary. But let us assume that this happens not
just between the shoemaker and the baker, but between all members of
society, i.e. between all commodity producers at once. And we have the
right to assume this, indeed we are compelled to make this assumption.
For all members of society have to live, they must satisfy their various
needs. The production of a society, as we already said, cannot stop for
a moment, since consumption does not stop for a moment. And we must now
add that since production is now split into individual independent
private labors, none of which is alone sufficient to satisfy a person,
exchange too cannot stop for a moment -- unless consumption does as
well. Everyone thus continues exchanging, with all their products. How
does this come about? Let us return to our example. The shoemaker not
only needs the product of the baker, he would like a certain quantity of
every other commodity as well. As well as bread, he needs meat from the
butcher, a coat from the tailor, the material for his shirt from the
weaver, a top hat from the hatter, etc. All these commodities he can
only obtain by way of exchange, but all that he can offer in return is
boots. For the shoemaker, accordingly, all products that he needs for
his life initially have the form of boots. If he needs bread, he first
makes a pair of boots; if he needs a shirt, he makes boots; if he needs
a hat or a cigar, he makes boots. In his special labor, the whole social
wealth accessible to him has the form of boots. It is only by exchange
on the commodity market that his work can be transformed from the
confined form of boots into the diverse form of means of subsistence.
But in order for this transformation to actually take place, for all
this diligent work of the shoemaker, which promised him every kind of
life's enjoyments, not to be stuck in the form of boots, one important
condition is needed, which we already know: it is necessary for all the
other producers, the product of whose labor our shoemaker needs, also to
need his boots and be ready to take them in exchange. The shoemaker then
only obtained all these other commodities if his product, boots, was a
commodity desired by all other producers. And at any particular time he
only obtained the quantity of all these other commodities that he could
exchange by way of his labor, if his boots were a commodity that
everyone wanted at any time, i.e. a commodity desired without limit.
Already in the case of the shoemaker, it was obviously quite a
presumption, and unfounded optimism, to believe that his special
commodity was so absolutely and unrestrictedly something indispensable
for the human race. But the matter gets much worse when not just the
shoemaker, but all other particular producers, find themselves in the
same position: the baker, the locksmith, the weaver, the butcher, the
hatter, the farmer, etc. Each of them desires and uses the most varied
products, but can only offer one single product in exchange. Each then
could only fully satisfy his needs if his special commodity were
constantly desired by everyone in society and taken in exchange. A brief
reflection will tell you that this is pure impossibility. It is
impossible for everyone to want all products equally at all times. It is
impossible for everyone at all times, without limit, to be a taker of
boots, bread, clothes, locks, yarn, shirts, hats and beard-covers. But
if this is not the case, then these products cannot all be exchanged at
any time against all others. And if exchange is not possible as a
constant all-round relationship, this means that the satisfaction of all
needs in society is impossible, consequently that all-round labor in
society is impossible, the very existence of society is impossible. And
we are again in a fix, and cannot solve the task we have set ourselves,
i.e. to explain how, from the divided and fragmented private producers,
who are not bound together by any social plan of labor, any
organization, any tie, a social collaboration and an economy can none
the less come into being. Exchange has indeed shown itself to be a means
able to regulate all this, even if in strange ways. But for this to
happen, exchange itself has to happen, it must function as a regular
mechanism. We find already in exchange itself, however, at the very
first step, such difficulties that we can not see at all how it is to
develop into an all-round and permanent business.

Yet the means for overcoming this difficulty and facilitating social
exchange have been found. True, it was no Columbus who discovered this,
social experience and habit unnoticeably found the means in exchange
itself; "life itself," as people say, solved the problem. As indeed,
social life, along with all its difficulties, always does create the
means for their solution. It is clearly impossible for all commodities
to be wanted by everyone all the time, i.e. to an unlimited extent. But
at any time, and in any society, there is _one_ commodity that is
important, necessary and useful to everyone as a foundation of their
existence, and is therefore wanted at any time. Boots could hardly be
this commodity, people are not that vain. But cattle, for example, could
be such a product. It is impossible to get by just with boots, nor even
with clothes, hats or corn. But cattle as a foundation of economic life
do secure a society's existence: they supply meat, milk, hides, plowing
service, etc. Among many nomadic peoples, indeed, their whole wealth
consists of herds of cattle. Still today, or at least until recently,
there were African tribes that lived almost exclusively from cattle. Let
us assume, then, that in our community cattle are a much-desired item of
wealth, not the only one, but one preferred over many other products
that are produced in society. The cattle-raiser here spends his private
labor on the production of cattle, just as the shoemaker does on boots,
the weaver on linen, etc. On our assumption, however, the product of the
cattle-raiser enjoys a general unlimited popularity above all others, as
it appears the most indispensable and important. Cattle are a welcome
enrichment for anyone. Since we still assume that in our society nothing
can be obtained by anyone except by way of exchange, it is clear that
the much-desired cattle can also only be obtained from the cattle-raiser
by exchange for another product of labor. But since, as presupposed,
everyone would like to have cattle, this means that anyone would be
happy at any time to part with his products against cattle. For cattle,
conversely, it follows that at any time one can have any kind of
product. Anyone who has cattle has only to choose, since everything is
available for him. And it is precisely for this reason, conversely, that
everyone is happier to exchange the particular product of his labor
against cattle than anything else; if he has cattle, then he has
everything, since everything is obtainable at any time in exchange for
cattle. If after a while this has become generally clear, and become a
custom, cattle then gradually become the universal commodity, i.e. the
single commodity that is universally desired and exchangeable without
limit. And as such a universal commodity, cattle mediate exchange
between all other special commodities. The shoemaker is unwilling to
directly accept bread from the baker in exchange for his boots, but he
will accept cattle, as with cattle he can then buy bread and all
possible things, whenever he wants. The baker, for his part, can pay for
his boots in cattle, as he has received cattle in return for his own
product, bread, as he also has from the locksmith, the stock-raiser and
the butcher. Each of these accepts cattle from others for their own
product, and pays again with the same cattle if he wants to have the
products of others. The cattle thus pass from one hand to another,
mediating every exchange and serving as the mental tie between the
individual commodity producers. (And the more, and more frequently,
cattle pass from one person to another as the mediator of business
exchange, the more their universal unlimited desirability is reinforced,
the more they become the only commodity desired and exchangeable at any
time, the universal commodity.)

We have already seen how each product of labor, in a society of
fragmented private producers without a communal plan of work, is
initially private labor. Whether this labor was socially necessary, i.e.
whether its produce has a value and secures the producer a share in the
products of the whole, whether it was not rather wasted labor, all this
is shown simply and solely by the fact that this product is accepted in
exchange. Now, however, all products are exchanged only against cattle.
Now, therefore, a product is socially necessary only in so far as it can
be exchanged against cattle. Its exchangeability against cattle, its
equivalence in value with cattle, is what now gives each private product
the hallmark of socially necessary labor. We have further seen that it
is only through commodity exchange that the individualized, isolated
private person is confirmed as a member of society. We must now say more
precisely that this is through exchange against cattle. Cattle are now
the valid embodiment of social labor, and accordingly the only social
tie between people.

You will certainly begin to feel at this point that we have rather got
carried away. Everything was fairly straightforward and comprehensible
up till now. But to conclude with cattle being the universal commodity,
cattle as the embodiment of social labor, even cattle as the only social
tie between people -- isn't this a crazy fantasy, even an insult to the
human race? And yet, if you think about it, there is no need to feel
insulted. For no matter how superior you might feel to these poor
cattle, it is clear at all events that they are much closer to humans --
rather similar in a way, at least much more similar -- than, let us say,
a lump of earth picked up from the ground or a pebble or a piece of
iron. You must admit that cattle are certainly more worthy of
representing the living social tie between people than is a dead piece
of metal. And yet humanity has precisely given preference here to metal.
For the important role of cattle in exchange that we described above is
in fact played by nothing other than _money_. If you cannot imagine
money in any other way than in the form of coined gold or silver pieces,
or even in paper banknotes, and you find this metal or paper money to be
completely self-evident as the universal mediator in dealings between
people, as a social power, but find my depiction of cattle playing this
role absurd, this only shows how full your head is with the ideas of the
present-day capitalist world. A picture of social relations that is
actually fairly reasonable strikes you as hare-brained, while you see as
self-evident something that really is completely crazy. In actual fact,
money in the form of cattle has exactly the same function as metallic
money, and it is nothing more than convenience that has led us to make
money out of metal. Cattle, of course, cannot be so easily exchanged, or
their value so precisely measured, as can equal-sized metal discs, not
to mention that storage of cattle-money requires far too big a purse,
something like a stable. But before humanity hit on the idea of making
money from metal, money had already long been the essential mediator of
exchange. For money, the universal commodity, is precisely the
indispensable means without which no universal exchange can get off the
ground, without which the existing unplanned social economy of
individual producers cannot exist.

We need only look now at the multifarious role of cattle in exchange.
What made cattle into money in the society we were examining? The fact
that they were a product of labor that was desired by everyone and at
all times. But why were cattle desired in this way? We said that it was
because they were an extremely useful product that could secure human
existence as a many-sided means of subsistence. That was originally
correct. But subsequently, the more that cattle were used as mediator in
universal exchange, the more the immediate use of cattle as means of
subsistence fell into the background. Anyone who receives cattle in
exchange for their product will now make sure not to butcher them and
eat them, nor to yoke them to the plough; cattle are more valuable to
him now as a means for buying any other commodity he might want at any
time. The receiver of cattle will therefore not now consume them as
means of subsistence, but rather store them as means of exchange for
future transactions. You will also note that the immediate use of
cattle, in the context of the highly developed division of labor that we
presuppose in this society, is also not easily feasible. What is the
shoemaker, for example, to do with these cattle? Or the locksmith, the
weaver and the hatter, who likewise do not have any land-holding? The
immediate use of cattle as means of subsistence is therefore
increasingly ignored, and the reason why cattle are then desired by
everyone at all times is no longer because they can be milked,
butchered, or yoked to the plough, but rather because they offer the
possibility at any time of exchange for any commodity you like. It
increasingly becomes the mission of cattle, their specific use, to
facilitate exchange, i.e. to serve for the transformation at any time of
private products into social ones, of private labors into social labors.
Since in this way the private use of cattle, that of serving as means of
subsistence, is increasingly ignored and they are instead devoted
exclusively to their function of continuous mediation between the
individual members of society, they gradually cease to be a private
product like any other, and become from the start, by nature -- right
from the stable, as it were -- a social product, and the labor of the
cattle-raiser is now distinct from all other labor in society in being
the only directly social labor. Cattle now are no longer raised just for
their use as means of subsistence, but directly with the object of
functioning as a social product, as the universal commodity. Of course,
to some extent cattle are still butchered or yoked to the plough. But
this so-to-speak private use and private character increasingly vanishes
in the face of their public character as money. And as such, they now
play a prominent and many-sided role in the life of society.

1: They definitively become the universal and publicly recognized _means
of exchange_. No one any longer exchanges boots for bread, or shirts for
horseshoes. Anyone who tried this would be met with a shrug of the
shoulders. It is only for cattle that anything can be bought. But in
this way, the previous two-way exchange breaks down into two separate
processes: selling and buying. Previously, when the locksmith and the
baker exchanged their products with one another, each simultaneously
with a handshake sold his own commodity and bought that of the other.
Buying and selling were a single business. Now, if the shoemaker sells
his boots, all he obtains and accepts in return are cattle. He first of
all sells his own product. Then, when he wants to buy something, _what_
he buys, and indeed whether he buys at all, is entirely up to him. It is
enough that the shoemaker has got rid of his product, and transformed
his labor from the form of boots into the form of cattle. The
cattle-form, however, is as we have seen the official social form of
labor, and the shoemaker can store labor in this form as long as he
wants, as he knows that he has the opportunity at any time of exchanging
the product of his labor again from the cattle-form into any other he
wants -- i.e. of making a purchase.

2: In the same way, however, cattle are now the means for storing and
accumulating wealth, they become a _treasury_. As long as the shoemaker
exchanged his product directly for means of subsistence, he also worked
only as much as he needed to in order to meet his daily needs. What use
would it have been to him to build up stocks of boots, or even large
stocks of bread, meat, shirts, hats, etc.? Objects of daily use are
generally damaged by prolonged storage, or even made unusable. Now,
however, the shoemaker can store the cattle he obtains for the products
of his labor as a resource for the future. Now, accordingly, a sense of
thrift is aroused in our tradesman, he seeks to sell as much as
possible, but makes sure not to spend again all the cattle he has
received; on the contrary, he seeks to accumulate them, since cattle are
now good for anything at any time, so he saves and stores them for the
future, leaving the fruits of his labor to his children as an
inheritance.

3: Cattle become at the same time also the _measure_ of all values and
labors. If the shoemaker wants to know what his pair of shoes will bring
him in exchange, what his product is worth, he says to himself, for
example: I get half a cow for each pair, my pair of boots is worth half
a cow.

4: Finally, in this way cattle become the _concept of wealth_. Now
people do not say, this or that person is rich because he has a great
deal of corn, flocks, clothes, jewelry or servants, but rather: he has
a good deal of cattle. People say, hats off to that man, he's "worth"
ten thousand oxen. Or they say, poor fellow, he doesn't have any cattle!

As you see, with cattle having become the universal means of exchange,
society can only think in the cattle-form. People always talk about
cattle, they even dream about them. A literal worship and admiration of
cattle develops. A girl is most easily married if her attraction is
increased by a dowry of large herds of cattle, even if her wooer is not
a mere swineherd, but a professor, an intellectual or a poet. Cattle are
the very concept of good fortune. Poems are written about cattle and
their miraculous power, crimes and murders are committed for the sake of
cattle. And people repeat, shaking their heads, that "cattle rule the
world." If you are not familiar with this proverb, you can translate it
into Latin; the old Roman word _pecunia_, meaning money, stems from
_pecus_, meaning cattle.

### 4.3

Our earlier investigation of how relations in the communistic community
would be reshaped after a sudden collapse of common property and
commonly planned labor, seemed to you no more than purely theoretical
rumination, wandering around in the clouds. In actual fact, this was
nothing other than an abbreviated and simplified depiction of the
historical rise of the commodity economy, its basic features strictly
corresponding to historical truth.

Yet a few corrections now need to be made to this depiction.

1) The process that we described as a catastrophe that happened
suddenly, destroying the communist society overnight and transforming it
into a society of private producers, in reality happened over millennia.
The idea of a transformation of this kind as a sudden and violent
catastrophe is certainly not pure fantasy. This idea does correspond to
reality, everywhere that primitive communist tribes come into contact
with other peoples already at a high capitalist stage of development. We
see cases like this with most discoveries and conquests of so-called
savage and semi-civilized lands by Europeans: the discovery of America
by the Spanish, the conquest of India by the English and of the East
Indies by the Dutch, and the same with the seizures of the English,
Dutch and Germans in Africa. In most of these cases, the sudden arrival
of Europeans in these lands was accompanied by a catastrophe in the
lives of the primitive peoples who inhabited them. What we have assumed
as a process of twenty-four hours, often needs no more than a few
decades. The conquest of territory by a European state, or the mere
settlement of a few European trading colonies in these countries, very
soon results in a violent abolition of common property in land, the
break-up and fragmentation of landownership into private property, the
confiscation of herds of cattle, the reversal of all traditional social
relations -- with the difference that the general result here is not, as
we assumed, the transformation of the communistic community into a
society of free private producers with commodity exchange. For the
dissolved common property does not become the private property of local
people, but rather the stolen goods of the European encroachers, and the
indigenous people themselves, robbed of their old forms and means of
existence, are made either into wage-slaves, or slaves pure and simple,
of European merchants, if they are not just exterminated, as happens
when neither of these two options is feasible. For primitive peoples in
colonized territories, therefore, the transition from primitive
communist conditions to modern capitalist ones always does take place as
a sudden catastrophe, an unforeseeable misfortune with the most
frightful sufferings (as it is presently true of the Germans with
Negroes of South West Africa). With the peoples of Europe, on the other
hand, it was not a catastrophe but rather a slow, gradual and
unnoticeable process, lasting for several hundred years. The Greeks and
Romans still appear in history with common property. The old Germans,
who spread from north to south soon after the birth of Christ,
destroying the Roman Empire and settling in Europe, still brought with
them the communistic primitive community, and maintained this for a good
while. The developed commodity economy of the European peoples, as we
described it, only came into being at the end of the Middle Ages, in the
fifteen and sixteenth centuries.

2) The second correction that has to be made to our depiction is a
consequence of the first. We assumed that all possible branches of labor
were already specialized and separate in the womb of the communist
community, i.e. that the division of labor in society had reached a very
high stage of development, so that with the occurrence of the
catastrophe that abolished common property and introduced private
production and exchange, the division of labor was already in place as
the basis for such exchange. This assumption is historically incorrect.
In the conditions of primitive society, so long as common property
persists, the division of labor is very little developed, still
embryonic. We have seen this in the example of the Indian village
community. Only a dozen or so individuals had separated out from the
mass of inhabitants to concentrate on special trades, no more than six
of these being actual artisans: the smith, the carpenter, the potter,
the barber, the washerman and the silversmith. Most handicraft work,
such as spinning, weaving, making clothes, baking, butchery,
sausage-making, etc., was all carried out by each family as a side
occupation along with their main agricultural work, as is still the case
even today in many Russian villages, in so far as the population have
not already been drawn into exchange and trade. The division of labor,
i.e. the separation of individual branches of labor as exclusive special
professions, can only properly develop if private property and exchange
are already in place. Only private property and exchange make possible
the emergence of particular special trades. For only when a producer has
the prospect of regularly exchanging his products against others does it
make sense for him to devote himself to specialized production. And it
is only money that gives each producer the possibility of storing and
accumulating the fruits of his efforts, and accordingly also the impetus
to regularly expand production for the market. On the other hand,
however, this producing for the market and accumulation of money only
has a purpose for the producer if his product and the receipts from it
are his private property. In the primitive communist community, however,
private property is precisely ruled out, and history shows us that
private property only arose as a result of exchange and the
specialization of labor. It turns out, therefore, that the emergence of
specialist professions, i.e. a highly developed division of labor, is
possible only with private property and developed exchange. It is
conversely clear, however, that exchange itself is possible only if the
division of labor is already present; for what purpose would there be in
exchange among producers who all produce one and the same thing? Only if
X for example only produces boots, whereas Y only bakes bread, is there
a sense and purpose in the two exchanging their products. We thus come
up against a strange contradiction: exchange is only possible with
private property and a developed division of labor, but this division of
labor can only come about as a result of exchange and on the basis of
private property, while private property for its part only arises
through exchange. This is even a double contradiction, if you examine it
closely: the division of labor must exist prior to exchange, even though
exchange must at the same time exist prior to the division of labor;
moreover, private property is the precondition for the division of labor
and exchange, but the only way it can develop is from the division of
labor and exchange. How is this tangle possible? We are clearly going
round in a circle, and even the first step away from the primitive
communist community seems an impossibility. Human society was apparently
caught in a contradiction here, whose resolution depended on the further
advance of development. But this inescapability is only apparent. A
contradiction may well be something inextricable for individuals in
everyday life, but in the life of society as a whole, you find
contradictions of this kind everywhere you look. What today appears as
the cause of a particular phenomenon is tomorrow its effect, and vice
versa, without this continuous change in conditions of social life ever
ceasing. On the contrary. The individual person cannot take a step
further when he faces a contradiction in his private life. He will even
accept in matters of everyday life that contradiction is something
impossible -- so that an accused person who gets tangled up in
contradictions when he appears in court is thereby already found guilty
of untruth, and in certain circumstances contradictions can lead him
into prison or even to the gallows. But human society as a whole
develops continuously in contradictions, and rather than succumbing to
these, it only starts to move when it meets contradictions.
Contradiction in the life of society, in other words, is always resolved
by development, in new advances of culture. The great philosopher
[G.W.F.] Hegel said: "Contradiction is the very moving principle of the
world." And this movement in the thick of contradictions is precisely
the actual mode of development of human society. In the particular case
we are concerned with here, i.e. the transition from communist society
to private property with the division of labor and exchange, the
contradiction that we found is also resolved in a particular
development, a long historical process. But this process was essentially
just as we originally depicted it, apart from the corrections we have
just made.

Exchange initially begins already in primitive conditions with common
property, and indeed, as we have assumed, in the form of barter, i.e.
product for product. We already find barter at very early stages of
human culture. Since exchange as we have depicted it, however, assumes
the private property of both parties involved, and this is unknown
within the primitive community, this early barter does not occur within
the community or tribe but rather outside, not between the members of
one and the same tribe, one and the same community, but rather between
different tribes and communities when they come into contact with one
another. And here it is not an individual member of one tribe who trades
with someone from another tribe, but rather tribes and communities as a
whole that enter into barter, represented always by their chiefs. The
widespread idea held by scholars of political economy of a primitive
hunter and fisherman who exchange their respective fish and game with
one another in the first dawn of human culture in the primeval forests
of America, is a double historical delusion. Not only were there in
primitive times, as we saw, no isolated individuals living and working
for themselves, but barter between individuals emerged only thousands of
years later. Initially, history knows only tribes and peoples bartering
with one another. As [Joseph François] Lafitau wrote in his book on the
American savages,

>Savage peoples constantly pursue exchange. Their trade has in common
>with the trade of antiquity that it represents an immediate exchange of
>products against products. Each of these peoples possesses something
>that the others do not, and trade conveys all these things from one
>people to the other. This includes corn, pottery, hides, tobacco,
>covers, canoes, cattle, household equipment, amulets, cotton -- in a
>word, everything used for the maintenance of human life ... Their trade
>is conducted by the chief of the tribe, who represents the whole
>people.

Moreover, if we began our earlier depiction of exchange with a
particular case -- exchange between shoemaker and baker -- and treated
this as something accidental, this again corresponds strictly to
historical truth. In the beginning, exchange between particular savage
tribes and peoples were purely accidental and haphazard; it depended on
chance encounters and contacts. This is why we see regular barter emerge
most early among nomadic peoples, since it is these, by their frequent
change of place, who came most frequently into contact with other
peoples. As long as exchange remains a matter of chance, it is only the
surplus products, what remains after meeting a tribe's or community's
own needs, that are offered in exchange for something else. Over time,
however, the more frequently such chance exchange is repeated, the more
it becomes a habit, then a rule, and gradually people start to produce
directly for exchange. Tribes and peoples thus increasingly specialize
in one or more particular branches of production, with the object of
exchange. A division of labor develops between tribes and communities.
In this connection, trade remains for a very long while pure barter,
i.e. direct exchange of product for product. In many regions of the
United States, barter was still widespread in the late eighteenth
century. In Maryland, the legislative assembly laid down the proportions
in which tobacco, oil, pork and bread were to be exchanged for one
another. In Corrientes [Argentina], as late as 1815, peddler boys ran
through the streets with the cry: "Salt for candles, tobacco for bread!"
In Russian villages until the 1890s, and in some parts still today,
traveling peddlers known as _prasols_ conducted simple barter with
peasants. All kinds of knickknacks, such as needles, thimbles, belts,
buttons, pipes, soap, etc. were exchanged for bristles, quilts, hare
pelts and the like. Potters, plumbers, etc. traveled through Russia with
their carts, exchanging their products for corn, linen, hemp, etc. With
the frequency and regularity of exchange transactions, however, it was
not long before, in each district and tribe, one commodity separated out
that was easiest to produce, and so could most frequently be given in
exchange, or alternatively one that was most lacking and so generally
desired. Such a role was played for example by salt and dates in the
Sahara desert, sugar in the English West Indies, tobacco in Virginia and
Maryland, so-called brick tea (a hard mixture of tea leaves and fat in
the form of a brick) in Siberia, ivory among the black Africans, cocoa
beans in ancient Mexico. In this way, the climatic and soil conditions
in various regions already led to the separating out of a "universal
commodity" that was suited to serve as a basis for all trade and a
mediator of all exchange transactions. The same occurred with subsequent
development from the particular occupation of each tribe. Among hunting
peoples, game was naturally the "universal commodity" that they offered
for all possible products. In the trade of the Hudson Bay Company, it
was beaver fat that played this role. Among fishing tribes, fish are the
natural mediator of all exchange. According to the account of a French
traveler, on the Shetland Islands change was given in fish even on the
purchase of a theatre ticket. The necessity of such a generally desired
commodity as universal mediator of exchange often made itself very
perceptible. The celebrated African traveler Samuel [White] Baker, for
example, described his exchange with tribes in central Africa:

>The difficulties of pro curing provisions are most serious: the only
>method of purchasing flour is as follows. The natives will not sell it
>for anything but flesh; to purchase an ox, I require molotes (hoes): to
>obtain molotes I must sell my clothes and shoes to the traders' men.
>The ox is then driven to a distant village, and is there slaughtered,
>and the flesh being divided into about a hundred small portions, my men
>sit upon the ground with three large baskets, into which are emptied
>minute baskets of flour as the natives produce them, one in exchange
>for each parcel of meat.

With the transition to stock raising, cattle become the universal
commodity in exchange and the universal measure of value. This was the
case among the ancient Greeks, as Homer describes it. In describing and
valuing the armor of each hero, for example, he says that the armor of
Glaucus was worth a hundred head of cattle and that of Diomedes nine. As
well as cattle, however, other products also served as money among the
Greeks of this time. Homer again says that during the siege of Troy,
wine from Lemnos was paid sometimes in hides, sometimes in oxen,
sometimes in copper or iron. Among the early Romans, as we said, the
concept of "money" was identical with that of cattle; among the ancient
Germans, too, cattle were the universal commodity. It was with the
transition to agriculture that metals, iron and copper, acquired a
surpassing importance in economic life, partly as material for producing
weapons, but still more so for agricultural implements. Metal became the
universal commodity as it was produced and used in greater quantities,
expelling cattle from this role. Initially it was the universal
commodity precisely because it was universally useful and desired for
its natural use -- as material for all kinds of tools. At this stage, it
was also used in trade as raw material, in bars and only by weight.
Among the Greeks it was iron that was in general use, among the Romans
it was copper, among the Chinese a mixture of copper and lead. Only much
later did the so-called precious metals, silver and gold, come into use,
and also into trade. But for a very long time these were still used in
trade in their raw state, uncoined and by weight. Here, accordingly, we
can still see the origin of the universal commodity, the money
commodity, from a simple product with a particular use. The simple piece
of silver that is given one day in exchange for flour might still be
used directly the next day to decorate a knight's shield. The exclusive
use of precious metal as money, i.e. coined money, was known neither to
the ancient Hindus nor to the Egyptians, nor again to the Chinese. The
ancient Jews likewise used metal pieces only by weight. Abraham, for
example, according to the Bible, when he bought a burial plot for Sarah
in Hebron, paid 400 shekels in weighed-out trading silver. It is
generally assumed that coinage only appeared in the tenth or even eighth
century BC, being first introduced by the Greeks. The Romans learned
from them, manufacturing their first silver and gold coins in the third
century BC. With the coining of money from gold and silver, the long,
millennial history of the development of exchange reached its fullest,
most complete and definitive form.

As we have said, money, i.e. the universal commodity, was already
developed before metals began to be used for monetary purposes. And even
in the form of cattle, for example, money has precisely the same
functions in exchange as gold coins do today: as mediator of
transactions, as measure of value, as store of value and as embodiment
of wealth. In the form of metallic money, however, the specific
characteristic of money is expressed also in its outward appearance. We
saw how exchange begins with the simple barter of any two products of
labor. It comes into being because one producer -- one community or
tribe -- cannot do without products of the other's labor. They assist
each other with the creations of their respective labor by exchanging
these. As such exchanges become frequent and regular, _one_ product
emerges as especially preferred, because universally desired, and this
becomes the mediator of all exchange transactions, the universal
commodity. Any product of labor has the intrinsic ability to become
money: boots or hats, linen or wool, cattle or corn, and we also see
that the most varied commodities have at times played this role. _Which_
commodity is chosen simply depends on the particular needs or particular
occupations of the people in question.

Cattle are initially preferred in this way as a useful product and means
of subsistence. With the passage of time, however, cattle are desired
and accepted as money. Cattle then make it possible for anyone to
accumulate the fruits of his labor in a form that is exchangeable at any
time for any other product of society's labor. Cattle, we said, as
distinct from all other private products, are the only directly social
product, the only one that is unrestrictedly exchangeable at any time.
But in cattle, the dual nature of the money commodity finds strong
expression: a glance at cattle shows how, despite being the universal
commodity and a social product, they are at the same time a simple means
of subsistence that can be butchered and eaten, an ordinary product of
human labor, the labor of herders. In the gold coin, however, any memory
of the origin of money out of a simple product has already quite
disappeared. The coined piece of gold is inherently unsuitable for
anything else, it has no other use but to serve as means of exchange, as
universal commodity. It is only still value in so far as it is, like any
other commodity, the product of human labor, the labor of the gold-miner
and goldsmith, but it has lost any private use as means of subsistence,
it is precisely nothing but a piece of human labor without any useful
and consumable form for private life, it no longer has any use as
private means of subsistence, as food, clothing, ornament or anything
else, its only purpose being its purely social use, to serve as mediator
in the exchange of other commodities. And it is precisely for this
reason that it appears in this meaningless and purposeless object: in
the gold coin, the purely social character of money, the universal
commodity, finds its purest and most mature expression.

The consequences of the definitive development of money in the metal
form are: sharp increase in trade, and decline of all social relations
that were previously geared not to trade but to self-sufficiency. The
ancient communistic community was shattered by trade, as this
accelerated the disparity of wealth among its members, the collapse of
common property, and finally the breakdown of the community itself.

The free small peasant economy, which initially produced everything for
itself and only sold its surplus, to put money under the mattress, was
gradually forced, particularly by the introduction of monetary taxation,
to sell its entire product, in order to buy not only food, clothing and
household articles, but even grain for sowing. We have seen an example
of such a transformation of the peasant economy, from one producing for
its own needs to one producing for the market and being ruined in the
process, with the last few decades in Russia. In ancient slavery, trade
brought about a profound change. So long as slaves were used only for
the domestic economy, for agricultural or artisanal tasks for the needs
of the master and his family, slavery still had a mild and traditional
character. Inhuman treatment of slaves began only when the Greeks, and
later the Romans, developed the taste for money and started producing
for trade, leading eventually to mass revolts by the slaves, which
although completely unsuccessful, were heralds and clear signs that
slavery had had its day and become unsustainable. Precisely the same
situation was presented by the _corvée_ in the Middle Ages. Initially
this was a relationship of protection, with the peasantry owing the
protecting lord a definite moderate sum, either in kind or in labor
services, towards the lord's own consumption. Later, when the nobles
learned the conveniences of money, these services and dues were steadily
increased for the purpose of trade, the _corvée_ relationship became one
of serfdom, and peasants were driven to the utmost limits. In the end,
the same spread of trade and the dominance of money led to dues in kind
being commuted from serfdom into monetary payments. But this meant that
the bell had tolled for the entire outmoded _corvée_ relationship.

Finally, trade in the Middle Ages brought power and wealth for the free
towns, but in this way also led to the break-up and decline of the old
guild handicrafts. Very early on, the appearance of metallic money made
world trade possible. Already in antiquity, certain peoples like the
Phoenicians devoted themselves to the role of merchants between peoples,
attracting large sums of money in this way and accumulating wealth in
the money form. In the Middle Ages, this role fell to the free towns,
initially the Italian ones. After the discovery of America and of the
sea route to the East Indies, at the end of the fifteenth century, world
trade experienced a sudden great expansion: the new lands offered not
only new products for trade, but also new gold mines, i.e. the money
material. Following the enormous import of gold from America in the
sixteenth century, the North German towns -- above all the Hanseatic
League -- acquired immense riches, and in their wake so did Holland and
England. As a result, in the European towns and to a large extent also
the countryside, commodity trade, i.e. production for exchange, became
the prevailing form of economic life. Exchange thus has its quiet and
unremarked beginnings in grey prehistory on the frontiers of savage
communist tribes, grows and develops alongside all successive planned
economic organizations, such as free simple peasant economy, Oriental
despotism, antique slavery, the medieval _corvée_ and the urban guild
regime, consuming these one after the other and helping to bring about
their collapse and finally the dominance of the completely anarchic,
unplanned economy of isolated private producers as the sole and
universally prevailing economic form.

### 4.4

Once commodity economy had become the prevailing form of production in
Europe by the eighteenth century, at least in the towns, scholars began
to study the question as to what was the foundation of this economy,
i.e. of universal exchange. All exchange is mediated by money, and the
value of every commodity in exchange has its monetary expression. What
then does this monetary expression mean, and what is the basis of the
value that each commodity has in trade? These were the first questions
that political economy investigated. In the second half of the
eighteenth and the early nineteenth century, the Englishmen Adam Smith
and David Ricardo made the great discovery that the value of each
commodity is nothing other than the human labor it contains, so that
with the exchange of commodities equal quantities of different kinds of
labor are exchanged for one another. Money is simply the mediator here,
and simply expresses in the price the corresponding amount of labor
contained in each commodity. It does indeed appear rather remarkable to
speak of this as a great discovery, since one might believe that nothing
was more clear and self-evident than that the exchange of commodities
depends on the labor they contain. It is just that the expression of the
commodity value in gold, which had become the general and exclusive
custom, concealed this natural state of affairs. At the time when the
shoemaker and the baker exchanged their respective products, as I said,
it was still obvious and visible that exchange came into being because,
despite their different uses, each of these took the same amount of
labor as the other, and each was therefore worth the same as the other
in so far as they both took the same amount of time. But if I say that a
pair of shoes costs ten marks, this expression is at first quite
puzzling when examined more closely. For what does a pair of shoes have
in common with ten marks, in what way are they equal, so that they can
be exchanged for one another? How can such different things be compared
with one another at all? And how can such a useful product as shoes be
exchanged for such a useless and meaningless object as stamped gold or
silver discs? Finally, how does it come about that precisely these
useless metal discs possess the magic power of obtaining anything in the
world by way of exchange? _All_ these questions, however, the great
founders of political economy, Smith and Ricardo, did not manage to
answer. For the discovery that what is contained in the exchange-value
of every commodity, even money, is simply human labor, and that the
value of a commodity is therefore that much greater, the more labor its
production requires, and vice versa, is only a half-truth. The other
half of the truth consists in the explanation of how and why it is that
human labor then assumes the strange form of exchange-value, and the
puzzling form of money at that. The English founders of political
economy did not even raise this question, since they considered it an
innate property of human labor, given in the nature of things, that it
created commodities for exchange and money. In other words, they assumed
it was just as natural as that people have to eat and drink, that hairs
grow on the head and that the face has a nose, that they have to produce
with their hands commodities for trade. They believed this so firmly
that Adam Smith, for example, raised the question in all seriousness
whether animals did not already conduct trade, and he only denied this
because at that time no such examples had yet been found in the animal
world. He says:

>[Quotation missing from manuscript; Hudis's notes indicate the Smith's
>passage didn't mean what Luxemburg thought, anyway -- red texts]

This naive conception, however, simply means that the great creators of
political economy lived in the rock-solid conviction that the present
capitalist social order, in which everything is a commodity and produced
only for trade, is the only possible and eternal social order, which
will endure as long as there are people on this earth. Only Karl Marx,
who as a socialist did not take the capitalist order to be the eternal
and only possible social form, but rather a passing historical one, made
comparisons between present relations and earlier ones at other times.
He showed in this way that people had lived for thousands of years
without knowing much about money and exchange. Only to the extent that
any common planned labor came to an end in society, and society
dissolved into a loose anarchic heap of completely free and independent
producers with private property, did exchange become the only means of
uniting these fragmented individuals and their labors into an integrated
social economy. In place of a common economic plan that precedes
production, money now becomes the only direct social means of
connection, which it does because it represents the only thing in common
between the many different private labors as itself a piece of human
labor without any particular use, i.e. precisely because it is a
completely meaningless product, unsuited for any kind of use in human
private life. This meaningless invention is thus a necessity without
which no exchange would be possible, i.e. the entire history of culture
since the dissolution of primitive communism. The bourgeois political
economists of course viewed money also as extremely important and
indispensable, but only from the standpoint of the purely external
convenience of monetary exchange. This can actually be said of money
only in the same sense that one can say that humanity has for example
invented religion for the sake of convenience. Money and religion are
certainly two powerful cultural products, but they have their roots in
quite particular and transient conditions, and, just as they arose, so
they will become superfluous in due course. The immense annual expenses
on gold production, just as the expenses on religion, not to mention
those on prisons, the military or public welfare, which are a heavy
burden on today's social economy, but are necessary costs given the
existence of this economic form, will disappear with the abolition of
the commodity economy.

The commodity economy, as we have got to know its inner mechanism,
appears before us as a wonderfully harmonious economic order, based on
the highest principles of morality. Firstly, complete individual freedom
prevails. Each person works as he likes, on what he likes and as much as
he likes; each is his own master and need only be governed by his own
preference. Secondly, they all exchange their commodities, i.e. the
products of their labor, for the products of other people's labor; labor
is exchanged against labor, and moreover, on average in equal
quantities. So there is also complete equality and reciprocity of
interests. Thirdly, in commodity economy commodity is exchanged for
commodity, one product of labor for another. Anyone therefore who does
not have a product of his labor to offer, anyone who does not work, will
also not obtain anything to eat. Here too we have the highest justice.
In fact, the philosophers and politicians of the eighteenth century, who
fought for the complete triumph of freedom of trade and the abolition of
the last vestiges of the old relations of domination -- the guild regime
and feudal serfdom -- the men of the Great French Revolution, promised
humanity a paradise on earth, in which freedom, equality and fraternity
would rule.

A number of leading socialists in the first half of the nineteenth
century were still of the same opinion. When scientific political
economy was created and Smith and Ricardo made the great discovery that
all commodity values were based on human labor, some friends of the
working class hit on the idea right away that if commodity exchange were
conducted correctly, there would necessarily be complete equality and
justice in society. If labor was always exchanged for labor in the same
quantities, it would be impossible for inequality of wealth to develop,
at most just the well-deserved inequality between hard workers and
idlers, and the whole social wealth would belong to those who work, i.e.
the working class. But if despite this we see great differences in
people's conditions in present society, if we see wealth alongside
poverty and what is more, wealth in the hands of non-workers and poverty
for those who create all values by their labor, this must obviously
arise from something wrong in the process of exchange, owing to the
intervention of money as mediator in the exchange of the products of
labor. Money conceals the real origin of all wealth in labor, provokes
constant fluctuations of price and thus gives the possibility of
arbitrary prices, swindling, and the accumulation of wealth at the cost
of others. So, away with money! This socialism aiming at the abolition
of money originated in England, represented there as early as the 1820s
and 30s by such talented writers as [William] Thompson, [John Francis]
Bray and others. The same kind of socialism was then rediscovered by
[Johann Karl] Rodbertus, in a Prussia of conservative Pomeranian Junkers
and brilliant writers on political economy; and finally by Proudhon in
France in 1849. Practical attempts in this direction were also
undertaken. Under the influence of the above-mentioned Bray, so-called
"bazaars" for "equitable labor exchange" were established in many
English towns, to which goods were brought to be exchanged without the
intervention of money, strictly in accordance with the labor-time they
contained. Proudhon also proposed the foundation of a so-called
"people's bank." But these attempts rapidly went bankrupt, along with
the theory behind them. Commodity exchange without money is in fact
inconceivable, and the price fluctuations that these people wanted to
abolish are in fact the only means for indicating to commodity producers
whether they are making too little of a particular commodity or too
much, whether they are spending more or less labor on its production
than it requires, whether they are producing the right commodities or
not. If this sole means of communication between the isolated commodity
producers in the anarchic economy is abolished, they are completely
lost, being not only struck dumb, but blind into the bargain. Production
necessarily comes to a standstill, and the capitalist tower of Babel
shatters into ruins. The socialist plans for making capitalist commodity
production into socialist simply by the abolition of money were thus
pure utopia.

How do things really stand then in commodity production, as far as
freedom, equality and fraternity are concerned? How can inequality of
wealth arise in the context of general commodity production, where it is
only for a product of labor that anyone can get anything, and where
equal values can only be exchanged for equal values? Yet present
capitalist society is precisely characterized, as everyone knows, by a
glaring inequality in people's material condition, by tremendous
accumulation of wealth in a few hands on the one side, and growing
poverty for the mass of people on the other. The subsequent question
that logically arises for us from all this is: _How is capitalism
possible in a commodity economy, given that commodities are exchanged
according to their value_?

## 5. Wage-labor

### 5.1

All commodities exchange against one another according to their value,
i.e. according to the socially necessary labor they contain. The fact
that money plays the role of mediator does not in any way change this
basis of exchange: money itself is simply the bare expression of social
labor, and the amount of value contained in each commodity is expressed
in the amount of money for which the commodity is sold. On the basis of
this law of value, complete equality prevails between commodities on the
market. And there would also be complete equality among the sellers of
commodities, if there were not, among the millions of different kinds of
goods coming onto the market for exchange, one particular commodity of a
quite special character -- labor-power. This commodity is brought to
market by those who possess no means of production of their own with
which to produce other commodities. In a society based exclusively on
commodity exchange, nothing is obtained, as we know, except by way of
exchange. We have indeed seen how the commodity that each person brings
to market is this person's unique claim and title to a share in the mass
of social products, and at the same time the measure of this share. Each
person obtains, in whatever commodities he chooses, exactly the same
amount of the mass of labor performed in society as he himself supplies
in socially necessary labor in the form of any kind of commodity. To be
able to live, therefore, each person must supply and sell commodities.
Commodity production and sale has become the condition for human
existence. Anyone who does not bring a commodity to market does not
receive any means of subsistence. But the production of any kind of
commodity requires means of labor, i.e. tools and the like, as well as
raw and ancillary materials, not to mention a place of work, equipped
with the necessary conditions of labor such as lighting, etc., and
finally a certain quantum of means of subsistence, to keep life going
until the process of production has been completed and the commodity is
sold. Only a few insignificant commodities can be produced without an
outlay on means of production: for example, mushrooms and berries that
grow in the forest, or shellfish collected on the shore by inhabitants
of the coast. But even here, certain means of production are always
necessary, such as baskets and the like, as well as means of subsistence
that make life possible during this labor. Most kinds of commodity,
however, in any society with developed commodity production, require a
quite significant outlay on means of production, sometimes a tremendous
one. Anyone without such means of production, who is thus not in a
position to produce commodities, has nothing for it but to bring himself
to market as a commodity, i.e. to bring his own labor-power.

Like any other commodity, the commodity labor-power also has its
definite value. The value of any commodity, as we know, is determined by
the amount of labor required for its production. In order to produce the
commodity labor-power, a particular amount of labor is likewise
necessary, i.e. the labor that produces the requisites of life for the
worker, food and clothing, etc. Whatever labor therefore is required in
order to keep a person capable of labor, to maintain his labor-power, is
also what his labor-power is worth. The value of the commodity
labor-power, therefore, is represented by the amount of labor that is
needed to produce the worker's means of subsistence. Moreover, as with
every other commodity, the value of labor-power is measured on the
market in terms of price, i.e. in money. The monetary expression, i.e.
the price of the commodity labor-power, is called the wage. With every
other commodity, the price rises when demand grows more quickly than
supply, and conversely falls when the supply of the commodity is greater
than demand. The same also holds for the commodity labor-power: with
rising demand for workers, wages show a general tendency to rise, and if
the demand falls or the labor-market is overfilled with fresh commodity,
wages show a tendency to fall. Finally, as with every other commodity,
the value of labor-power, and along with it ultimately its price as
well, is higher if a greater amount of labor is required for its
production: in this case, if the worker's means of subsistence require
more labor for their production. And conversely, every saving on the
labor required to produce the worker's means of subsistence leads to a
reduction in the value of labor-power, and thus also in its price, i.e.
in wages. As David Ricardo wrote in 1817:

>Diminish the cost of production of hats, and their price will
>ultimately fall to their new natural price, although the demand should
>be doubled, trebled, or quadrupled. Diminish the cost of subsistence of
>men, by diminishing the natural price of the food and clothing, by
>which life is sustained, and wages will ultimately fall,
>notwithstanding that the demand for laborers may very greatly increase.

The only way, therefore, in which the commodity labor-power is initially
distinguished from other commodities on the market is that it is
inseparable from its seller, the worker, so that it cannot tolerate any
long wait for buyers, otherwise it will disappear along with its bearer,
the worker, for lack of means of subsistence, whereas most other
commodities can tolerate a more or less long waiting-time quite well.
The particularity of the commodity labor-power is thus not yet expressed
on the market, where it is only exchange-value that plays a role. It
lies elsewhere -- in the use-value of this commodity. Every commodity is
bought on account of the utility that its consumption can bring. Boots
are bought in order to serve as clothing for the feet; a cup is bought
so that tea can be drunk from it. What use then can labor-power serve
when purchased? Obviously, that of laboring. But this scarcely says
anything yet. People at every time could and had to work, ever since the
human race existed, and yet whole millennia passed in which labor-power
was completely unknown as a purchasable commodity. On the other hand, if
we imagine that a person, with his full labor-power, was only in a
position to produce the means of subsistence that he himself needed,
then the purchase of such labor-power, i.e. of labor-power as a
commodity, would be quite senseless. For if someone buys and pays for
labor-power, puts it to work with his own means of production, and only
obtains at the end of the day the maintenance of the bearer of his
purchased commodity, the worker, this means that the worker by selling
his labor-power only obtains someone else's means of production in order
to work with these for himself. From the standpoint of commodity
exchange this would be a senseless deal, just as if someone were to buy
boots simply to return them to the shoemaker as a present. If this were
the only use of human labor-power, it would have no utility for the
purchaser and accordingly could not appear on the market as a commodity.
For only products with a definite utility can figure as commodities. If
labor-power appears as a commodity, therefore, it is not enough that the
person concerned can work, if he is given means of production, but
rather that he can work more than is needed for the production of his
own means of subsistence. He must be able to work not only to support
himself, but also work for the buyer of his labor-power. The commodity
labor-power, therefore, in its use, i.e. in labor, must not simply be
able to replace its own price, i.e. the wage, but on top of this also
supply surplus labor for the purchaser. And indeed, the commodity
labor-power does have this convenient property. But what does this mean?
Is it a kind of natural property of man, or of the worker, that he can
perform surplus labor? At the time when it took people a year to make an
axe out of stone, or hours rubbing two sticks of wood together to make a
fire, when it took several months to make a single bow, even the
cleverest and most unscrupulous entrepreneur would have been unable to
press any surplus labor out of anyone. A certain level of productivity
of human labor is therefore required in order for any surplus-labor at
all to be provided. In other words, human tools, skills and knowledge,
human domination over natural forces, must already have reached a
certain level, not simply to be able to produce means of subsistence for
the worker himself, but on top of this also to produce for others. This
perfection of tools and knowledge, however, this degree of mastery of
nature, was only acquired by human society through long millennia of
painful experience. The distance from the first crude stone instruments
and the discovery of fire through to today's steam and electrical
machinery, represents humanity's whole course of social development, a
development that was possible only within society, by people's social
coexistence and collaboration. The productivity of labor, therefore,
that endows the labor-power of the present-day wage-laborer with the
convenient property of performing surplus labor, is not a physiological
particularity of the human being, something given by nature, but rather
a _social phenomenon_, the fruit of a long developmental history. The
surplus labor of the commodity labor-power is simply another expression
for the productivity of social labor, which manages to maintain several
people from the labor of one.

The productivity of labor, however, particularly where it is assisted
even at a primitive cultural level by fortunate natural conditions, does
not always and everywhere lead to the sale of labor-power and its
capitalist exploitation. Let us transport ourselves for a moment to
those favored tropical regions of Central and South America that were
Spanish colonies from the discovery of the New World until the early
nineteenth century, and where bananas are the main food of the native
population. "I doubt whether there is another plant on the globe which
on so small a space of ground can produce so considerable a mass of
nutritive substance," wrote Alexander von Humboldt:

>According to this last principle, and the fact is very curious, we find
>that in a very fertile country a demi hectare ... cultivated with
>bananas of the large species (_platano arton_), is capable of
>maintaining fifty individuals; when the same in Europe would only yield
>annually, supposing the eight-grain, 576 kilograms of flour, a quantity
>not equal to the subsistence of two individuals.

Besides, bananas require for their production only the slightest human
effort, needing only one or two light rakings of the earth around their
roots. "At the foot of the Cordillera, in the humid valleys of the
intendancies of Vera Cruz, Valladolid, and Guadalajara, a man who merely
employs two days in the week in a work by no means laborious may procure
subsistence for a whole family."

It is clear that the productivity of labor here would certainly permit
exploitation, and a scholar with a true capitalist soul, such as
[Thomas] Malthus, could exclaim in tears at the description of this
earthly paradise: "What immense powers for production are here
described! What resources for unbounded wealth ...!" In other words, how
splendidly gold could be beaten out of the work of the banana-eaters by
zealous entrepreneurs, if these lazy-bones could only be harnessed to
labor. But what do we actually see? The inhabitants of these favored
regions did not think of accumulating money, but simply examined the
banana trees, tasted their respective fruit, and spent a lot of free
time lying in the sun and enjoying life. Humboldt says very pertinently
of them:

>We hear it frequently repeated in the Spanish colonies, that the
>inhabitants of the warm region (_tierra caliente_) will never awake
>from the state of apathy in which for centuries they have been plunged,
>until a royal _cedula_ shall order the destruction of the banana
>plantations (_plantanares_).

What from the capitalist standpoint is described as "apathy" is
precisely the mental state of all peoples still living in relations of
primitive communism, in which the purpose of human labor is simply to
satisfy people's natural needs, and not the accumulation of wealth. But
so long as these conditions prevail, then no matter how productive labor
is, there can be no question of the exploitation of one person by
another, the application of human labor-power for the production of
surplus labor.

The modern entrepreneur, however, was not the first to discover this
convenient property of human labor-power. We already see the
exploitation of surplus labor by non-workers in ancient times. Slavery
in antiquity, as well as the _corvée_ relationship and serfdom in the
Middle Ages, were both based on a level of productivity already
attained, i.e. the capacity of human labor to maintain more than one
person. Both are also simply different forms in which one class of
society made use of this productivity in order to have itself maintained
by another class. In this sense, the antique slave and the medieval serf
are direct forerunners of today's wage-laborer. But neither in antiquity
nor the Middle Ages did labor-power become a commodity, despite its
productivity and despite its exploitation. What is particular in the
present-day relationship between wage-laborer and entrepreneur, what
distinguishes it from both slavery and serfdom, is above all the
personal freedom of the laborer. The sale of commodities is the
voluntary and private business of each person, based on complete
individual freedom. An unfree person cannot sell his labor-power. A
further condition for this, however, is that the worker possesses no
means of production. If he did, he would produce commodities himself and
not part with his labor-power as a commodity. The separation of
labor-power from the means of production, accordingly, is another factor
along with personal freedom that makes labor-power today a commodity. In
the slave economy, labor-power is not separated from the means of
production; on the contrary, it is itself a means of production and
belongs together with tools, raw materials, etc. to the master as his
private property. The slave is simply part of the indistinguishable mass
of the slaveholder's means of production. In _corvée_ labor, labor-power
is legally tied directly to the means of production, to the soil, it is
itself simply an accessory to the means of production. _Corvée_ services
and dues are not in fact the responsibility of individuals but of the
plot of land; if the land is transferred to other hands, by inheritance
or likewise, the dues go along with it. Today the worker is personally
free, he is neither anyone's property nor is he tied to the means of
production. On the contrary, the means of production belong to one
person, labor-power to another, and the two owners face each other as
independent and free, as buyer and seller -- the capitalist as buyer of
labor-power, the worker as its seller. Finally, however, neither
personal freedom nor the separation of labor-power from the means of
production always lead to wage-labor, to the sale of labor-power, even
at a high level of labor productivity. We saw an example of this kind in
ancient Rome, after the great mass of free small peasants were driven
from their lands by the formation of large noble estates with a slave
economy. They remained personally free, but no longer had any land, any
means of production, so that they moved massively from the countryside
to Rome as free proletarians. Here, however, they could not sell their
labor-power, as there were no buyers to be had; the rich landowners and
capitalists did not need to buy free labor-power, being maintained by
the work of slaves. Slave labor at that time was completely sufficient
to satisfy all the landowners' needs, as they had everything possible
made by slaves. But labor-power could not be used for more than their
own living and luxury, the very purpose of slave production being the
owner's consumption rather than the sale of commodities. In this way,
the Roman proletarians were excluded from all sources of wealth deriving
from their own labor, and there was nothing left for them but to live
from beggary -- beggary from the state, from periodic distributions of
means of subsistence. Instead of wage-labor, accordingly, what arose in
ancient Rome was the mass feeding of property-less free people at the
cost of the state, which led the French economist [Jean Charles Léonard
de Sismondi] to say that in ancient Rome the proletariat lived at the
expense of society, whereas today society lives at the expense of the
proletariat. But if today it is possible for proletarians to work for
both their own consumption and that of others, if the sale of their
labor-power is possible, this is because today free labor is the _sole_
and exclusive form of production, and because as commodity production it
is precisely not geared to direct consumption, but rather to the
creation of products for sale. The slaveholder bought slaves for his own
comfort and luxury, the feudal lord extracted services and dues from the
_corvée_ peasants for the same purpose: to live literally like a lord,
along with his clan. The modern entrepreneur does not get workers to
produce objects of food, clothing and luxury for his own consumption,
but rather commodities for sale, in order to obtain money. And it is
precisely this that makes him a capitalist, just as it makes the workers
into wage-laborers.

We see, then, how the simple fact of the sale of labor-power as a
commodity implies a whole series of particular social and historical
relations. The mere appearance of labor-power as a commodity on the
market indicates: 1) the personal freedom of the workers; 2) their
separation from the means of production along with the accumulation of
means of production in the hands of non-workers; 3) a high level of
productivity of labor, thus the possibility of performing surplus labor;
4) the general prevalence of commodity economy, i.e. the creation of
surplus labor in the commodity form as the purpose of the purchase of
labor-power.

Externally, from the standpoint of the market, the sale and purchase of
the commodity labor-power is a completely ordinary business, one of
thousands that take place every moment, like the purchase of boots or
onions. The value of the commodity and its alterations, its fluctuating
price, the equality and independence of buyer and seller on the market,
the voluntary character of the deal -- all this is exactly as with any
other transaction. But owing to the particular use-value of this
commodity, the particular conditions that create it as a use-value, this
everyday market transaction becomes a new and quite particular social
relation. Let us examine more closely what this market transaction leads
to.

### 5.2

The entrepreneur buys labor-power and like any purchaser pays its value,
i.e. its production costs, by paying the worker as his wage a price that
covers the worker's maintenance. But this purchased labor-power is
capable, with the average means of production used in society, to
produce more than simply its own maintenance costs. This is already, as
we know, a precondition of the whole business, which would otherwise be
senseless; it is precisely here that the use-value of the commodity
labor-power lies. Since the value of maintaining labor-power is
determined, as with any other commodity, by the amount of labor required
for its production, we can assume that the food, clothing, etc. that are
needed for the daily maintenance of the worker in a condition capable of
labor require, let us say for example, six hours' labor. The price of
the commodity labor-power, i.e. its wage, must then normally come to six
hours' labor in money. But the worker spends not just six hours working
for his entrepreneur but longer, let us say for example eleven hours. In
these eleven hours, the worker firstly spends six hours reimbursing the
wage he receives, and on top of this provides five hours of labor for
nothing, which the entrepreneur gets for free. The working day of each
worker thus necessarily and normally consists of two parts: one paid, in
which the worker simply reimburses the value of his maintenance, in
which he works as it were for himself, and an unpaid part, in which he
performs free or surplus labor for the capitalist.

The situation was similar in earlier forms of social exploitation. In
the days of bondage, the labor of the serf for himself and his labor for
his master were even distinct in time and space. The peasant knew
exactly when and for how long he worked for himself, and when and for
how long he worked for the maintenance of his noble lord, whether
temporal or spiritual. He worked first for a few days on his own plot,
then for a few days on that of the lord, or else he worked in the
morning on his own plot and in the afternoon on that of the lord, or he
worked continuously for some weeks on the one and then for some weeks on
the other. In one particular village, for example, belonging to the
Maurusmünster Abbey in Alsace, _corvée_ labor in the mid-twelfth century
was laid down as follows: from mid April to mid May, each peasant
household to provide three full days' labor per week, from May to
Midsummer's day one afternoon per week, from Midsummer's day to
haymaking two days per week, then three afternoons per week until
harvest, and from Martinmas to Christmas three full days per week. In
the later Middle Ages, to be sure, with advancing enserfment, work for
the lords increased steadily, so that almost every day in the week and
every week in the year was taken up by _corvée_, and the peasants had
scarcely any time left to cultivate their own fields. But in that era
they knew quite precisely that they were working not for themselves but
for someone else. Even the dumbest peasant could not possibly be
mistaken on this score.

With modern wage-labor, matters are quite different. The worker does not
produce in one part of his working day, as it were, objects that he
needs himself: his food, clothing, etc., then in another part of the day
other things for the entrepreneur. On the contrary, the worker in the
factory or workshop spends the whole day producing one and the same
object, which generally means an object that he needs only in very small
amounts, if at all, for his own private consumption: for example, steel
pens, or rubber bands, or silk cloth, or iron tubes. In the
indistinguishable heap of steel pens or rubber bands or cloth that he
has created in the course of the day, each piece looks just like any
other, to a hair, there is not the slightest difference according to
whether one part of this quantity is paid labor and the other part
unpaid, whether one part is for the worker and the other for the
entrepreneur. On the contrary, the product that the worker produces has
no utility at all for him, and not a tiny bit of it belongs to him;
everything that the worker produces belongs to the entrepreneur. Here we
see a major outward difference between wage-labor and serfdom. The
_corvée_ peasant, in normal conditions, necessarily had to have some
time on which to work on his own land, and the product of his labor
there belonged to him. With the modern wage-laborer, his whole product
belongs to the entrepreneur, and so it looks as if his work in the
factory has nothing at all to do with his maintenance. He has received
his wage and can do with it what he will. In return for the wage, he has
to work at what the entrepreneur tells him, and everything he produces
belongs to the entrepreneur. But the difference that is invisible to the
worker is clear enough in the entrepreneur's accounts, when he
calculates his receipts from the production of his labor. For the
capitalist, this is the difference between the sum of money he receives
from the sale of the product, and his outlays both on means of
production and on his workers' wages. What remains for him as profit is
precisely the value created by unpaid labor, i.e. the surplus value that
the workers have created. Each worker then produces, first of all his
own wage, and then a surplus value that the capitalist gets for free. If
he has woven eleven meters of silk cloth in eleven hours, then six
meters of this may contain the value of his wage, and five meters are
surplus value for the entrepreneur.

But the distinction between wage-labor and slave or _corvée_ labor has
still more important consequences. Both the slave and the _corvée_
peasant performed their labor principally for their own private need and
for the master's consumption. They produced for their master objects of
food and clothing, furniture, luxury goods, etc. This was at all events
the norm, before slavery and serfdom degenerated under the influence of
trade, and were approaching their end. The ability of a person to
consume, however, i.e. luxury in private life, has definite limits in
each era. The antique slaveholder or the medieval noble could not
consume more than full barns, full stables, rich clothes, richly
appointed rooms, a sumptuous life for themselves and their household.
Objects like these, which they needed for everyday life, could not even
be stored in large quantities, as they would perish: grain easily
succumbs to rot or is eaten by rats and mice; stocks of hay and straw
readily catch fire, clothing is damaged, dairy products, fruit and
vegetables are very hard to preserve. Even with a sumptuous lifestyle,
therefore, consumption in both slave and _corvée_ economy had its
natural limits, and this also set limits to the normal exploitation of
the slaves and peasants. It is different with the modern entrepreneur,
who buys labor-power in order to produce commodities. What the worker
produces in the factory or workshop is generally quite useless for
himself, and equally useless for the entrepreneur. The latter does not
put the labor-power he purchases to work at producing food and clothing,
but has it produce commodities that he himself does not need. He only
has silk or metal tubes or coffins produced so as to get rid of them by
sale as quickly as possible. He has them produced in order to obtain
money by their sale. And he receives back his outlays, as well as the
surplus labor that his workers supply him with for free, in the money
form. It is to this end, to turn the workers' unpaid labor into money,
that he conducts his whole business and buys labor-power. But money, as
we know, is the means for unlimited accumulation of wealth. In the money
form, wealth does not lose value by lengthy storage. On the contrary, as
we shall go on to see, wealth in the money form even seems to grow as a
result of storage. And in the money form, wealth know no limits at all,
it can grow endlessly. The hunger of the modern capitalist for surplus
labor accordingly knows no limits. The more unpaid labor can be pressed
out of the workers, the better. To extract surplus value, and extract it
without limit, is the particular purpose and task of the purchase of
labor-power.

The natural drive of the capitalist to expand the surplus value
extracted from the workers takes two simple paths, which present
themselves automatically, as it were, when we consider the composition
of the working day. We saw how the working day of every wage-laborer
normally consists of two parts: a part in which the worker receives back
his own wage, and a further part in which he supplies unpaid labor,
surplus value. In order to expand this second part as much as possible,
the entrepreneur can proceed along two routes: either extend the whole
working day, or shorten the first, paid part of the working day, i.e.
reduce the wage of the worker. In actual fact the capitalist uses both
methods at the same time, which gives the system of wage-labor a
constant dual tendency: to the extension of working time, and to the
reduction of wages.

If the capitalist buys the commodity labor-power, he does so as with any
other commodity, in order to derive utility from it. Every commodity
buyer seeks to get as much use as possible from his commodities. If we
buy boots, for example, we want to wear them for as long as possible.
The buyer of the commodity enjoys the full use and utility of the
commodity. The capitalist, accordingly, who has bought the commodity
labor-power, has the full right, from the standpoint of commodity
purchase, to demand that the purchased commodity serve him for as long
as possible and as much as possible. If he has paid for a week's
labor-power, then the use of it belongs to him for a week, and in his
capacity as purchaser he has the right to have the worker labor up to
twenty-four hours for each of the seven days. The worker, on the other
hand, as seller of the commodity, has a completely opposed position.
While the capitalist does indeed have the use of his labor-power, this
meets its limits in the physical and mental capacity of the worker. A
horse cannot work for more than eight hours, day in, day out, without
being ruined. A human being, likewise, in order to restore the energy
spent in labor, needs a certain time for eating, clothing, rest, etc. If
he does not have this, then his labor-power is not simply used, but
destroyed. The worker is weakened by excessive labor and his life cut
short. If each week the capitalist shortens the life of the worker by
two weeks, by limitless consumption of his labor-power, this is the same
as if he were appropriating three weeks for the wage of one. From the
same standpoint of commodity exchange, this means that the capitalist is
robbing the worker. In relation to the working day, capitalist and
worker represent two diametrically opposed positions on the commodity
market, and the actual length of the working day is decided only by
struggle between the capitalist class and the working class, as a
_question of power_. Inherently, therefore, the working day has no
definite limits; in different times and places we find working days of
eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen and eighteen hours. And as a
whole, the struggle over the length of the working day lasts for
centuries. We can distinguish two major phases in this struggle. The
first begins in the late Middle Ages, in the fourteenth century, when
capitalism took its first hesitant steps and began to shatter the firm
protective armor of the guild regime. The normal customary working time,
in the golden age of handicrafts, amounted perhaps to ten hours, with
meal times, sleep, recreation, rest on Sundays and feast days being
comfortably observed in all particulars. This was sufficient for
traditional handicraft with its slow methods of work, but it was not
sufficient for the early manufacturing enterprises. The first thing that
the capitalists required from governments, accordingly, was the
extension of working time. Between the fourteenth and the late
seventeenth centuries, we see in England, France and Germany specific
laws covering the _minimum working day_, i.e. bans on workers and
journeymen working less than a definite working time, which was
generally twelve hours per day. The great cry from the Middle Ages down
to the eighteenth century is the struggle against workers' idleness. But
once the power of the old guild handicrafts was broken, and a massive
proletariat lacking any means of labor and forced to sell its
labor-power appeared, while on the other hand large factories with
feverish mass production arose, the page turned in the eighteenth
century. A sudden consumption of workers of every age and both sexes
began, with entire populations of workers being mown down in a few years
as if by plague. A British MP declared in Parliament in 1863: "The
cotton trade has existed for ninety years ... It has existed for three
generations of the English race, and I believe I may safely say that
during that period it has destroyed nine generations of factory
operatives." And a bourgeois English writer, John Wade, wrote in his
book on the _History of the Middle and Working Classes_, "The cupidity
of mill-owners whose cruelties in the pursuit of gain have hardly been
exceeded by those perpetrated by the Spaniards in the conquest of
America in the pursuit of gold." In the 1860s in England, in certain
branches of industry such as stocking making, children of nine or ten
years old were occupied from two, three or four o'clock in the morning
until ten, eleven or twelve at night. In Germany, the conditions that
prevailed until recently, in mirror manufacture and in baking, for
example, are sufficiently well known. It was modern capitalist industry
that first succeeded in making the formerly quite unknown discovery of
nightwork. In all earlier social conditions, night was seen as a time
determined by nature itself for human rest. The capitalist enterprise
discovered that surplus value extracted from the worker at night was in
no way different from that extracted by day, and introduced day and
night shifts. Sundays, which in the Middle Ages were most strictly
observed by the handicraft guilds, were sacrificed to the capitalists'
hunger for surplus value, and equated with other working days. On top of
this were dozens of little inventions to extend working time: taking
meals on the job without a pause, cleaning machines after the regular
working day ends, i.e. during the workers' rest time, and so on. This
practice of the capitalists, which prevailed quite freely and unimpeded
in the early decades, soon made necessary a series of new laws about the
working day -- this time not to forcibly extend working hours, but
rather to curtail them. And the first legal restrictions on the maximum
working day were not forced by the pressure of workers, but by
capitalist society's own instinct for self-preservation. The first few
decades of unrestricted operation of large-scale industry produced such
a devastating effect on the health and living conditions of the mass of
working people, with tremendous mortality, disease, physical crippling,
mental desperation, epidemic disease and unfitness for military service,
that the very survival of society seemed deeply threatened. It was clear
that if the natural drive of capital for surplus value were not reined
in by the state, whole states would sooner or later be turned into giant
cemeteries, in which only the bones of workers would be visible. But
without workers there is no exploitation of workers. In its own
interest, accordingly, in order to secure the future of exploitation,
capital had to set some limits to present exploitation. The strength of
the people had to be protected to a certain extent, in order to secure
their future exploitation. A transition was necessary from an unviable
economy of robbery to rational exploitation. This gave rise to the first
laws on the maximum working day, along with bourgeois social reform in
general. We can see a counterpart of this in the hunting laws. Just as
game are protected by law for a definite time, so that they can multiply
rationally and regularly as an object for hunting, in the same way
social reform ensures the labor-power of the proletariat a certain time
of protection, so that it can serve rationally for exploitation by
capital. Or, as Marx put it, the restriction of factory work was
dictated by the same necessity that forces the landowner to spread
fertilizer over the fields. Factory legislation was born in a hard
struggle of decades against the resistance of individual capitalists,
initially for children and women, and in particular industries step by
step. France then followed, where the February revolution of 1848, under
the initial pressure of the victorious Paris proletariat, proclaimed the
twelve-hour working day, this being also the first general law on the
working time of all workers, including adult men in all branches of
industry. In the United States, a general movement of workers for the
eight-hour day began immediately after the Civil War of 1861[-65], which
abolished slavery, a movement that then spread to Europe. In Russia, the
first protective legislation for women and minors arose from the great
factory disturbances of 1882 in the Moscow industrial zone, and a
working day of eleven and a half hours for adult men was the result of
the first general strike of 60,000 textile workers in St Petersburg in
1896-97. Germany is now limping behind all other major modern states,
with protective legislation only for women and children.

So far we have spoken only of one particular aspect of wage-labor,
working time, and here we already see how the simple commodity
transaction of buying and selling labor-power has many particular
features. But it is necessary here to recall Marx's words:

>It must be acknowledged that our worker emerges from the process of
>production looking different from when he entered it. In the market, as
>owner of the commodity "labor-power," he stood face to face with other
>owners of commodities, one owner against another owner. The contract by
>which he sold his labor-power to the capitalist proved in black and
>white, so to speak, that he was free to dispose of himself. But when
>the transaction was concluded, it was discovered that he was no "_free
>agent_," that the period of time for which he _is free_ to sell his
>labor-power is the period of time for which he _is forced_ to sell it,
>that in fact the vampire will not let go "while there remains a single
>muscle, sinew or drop of blood to be exploited." For "protection"
>against the serpent of their agonies, the workers have to put their
>heads together and, _as a class_, compel the passing of a law, an
>all-powerful _social barrier_ by which they can be prevented from
>selling themselves and their families into slavery and death by
>_voluntary contract with capital_.

Labor protection legislation is in fact the first official
acknowledgement by present-day society that the formal equality and
freedom on which commodity production and exchange is based already
breaks down, collapses into inequality and unfreedom, as soon as
labor-power appears on the market as a commodity.

### 5.3

The capitalists' second method for expanding surplus value is the
reduction of wages. Like the working day, wages also have no definite
limits. Above all, if we speak of the wages of labor, we need to
distinguish between the money that the worker receives from the
entrepreneur, and the quantity of means of subsistence that he obtains
for this. If all we know about a worker's wage is that he is paid, for
example, two marks per day, we effectively know nothing. For when prices
are high, the same two marks will buy much less in terms of means of
subsistence than when prices are low. In one country, the same two-mark
coin means a different standard of living than it does in another, and
the same applies to almost every region within a country. The worker may
even receive more money as his wage than previously, and at the same
time live not better but just as badly, or even worse. The real, actual
wage, therefore, is the sum of means of subsistence that the worker
obtains, whereas the money wage is only the nominal wage. If the wage is
then simply the monetary expression of the value of labor-power, this
value is actually represented by the amount of labor that is spent on
the worker's necessary means of subsistence. But what are these
"necessary means of subsistence"? Aside from individual differences
between one worker and another, which play no role, the different
standard of living of the working class in different countries and at
different times already shows that the concept "necessary means of
subsistence" is very variable and flexible. The better-off English
worker of today considers his daily intake of beefsteak as necessary for
life, while the Chinese coolie lives on a handful of rice. In connection
with the flexibility of the concept "necessary means of subsistence," a
similar struggle develops over the level of wages as it does over the
length of the working day. The capitalist, as buyer of commodities,
explains his position as follows: "Is it not quite completely correct
that I must pay its proper value for the commodity labor-power, just
like any honest purchaser? But what is the value of labor-power? The
necessary means of subsistence? Well, I give my worker exactly as much
as is necessary for his life; but as to what is absolutely necessary to
keep someone alive, this is a matter for science first of all, i.e. for
physiology, and secondly a matter of general experience. And it goes
without saying that I give exactly this minimum; for if I were to give a
penny more, I would not be an honest purchaser, but rather a fool, a
philanthropist, making a gift from my own pocket to the person from whom
he has bought a commodity. I don't give my shoemaker or cigarette seller
a penny extra, but try to buy their commodities as cheaply as possible.
In the same way, I try to buy labor-power as cheaply as possible, and we
are completely on the level if I give my worker the barest minimum that
he needs to maintain his life." The capitalist here is completely within
his rights, from the standpoint of commodity production. But the worker
is no less within his rights when he responds to the commodity
purchaser: "Of course I cannot claim more than the actual value of my
commodity, labor-power. But what I demand is that you really do pay me
its full value. I don't want anything more than the necessary means of
subsistence. But what means of subsistence are necessary? You say that
the answer to this is supplied by the science of physiology and by
experience, and that these show what is the minimum a person needs in
order to maintain life. What you refer to here, by the concept of
'necessary means of subsistence' is therefore the absolutely,
_physiologically_ necessary. But this is against the law of commodity
exchange. For you know as well as I do that what decides the value of
every commodity on the market is the labor _socially_ necessary for its
production. If your shoemaker offers you a pair of boots and asks 20
marks for them, as he has spent four days working on them, you will
reply: 'I can get boots like this from the factory for only 12 marks, as
they can be made in a day with machinery. Given that it is now usual to
produce boots by machine, your four days' work was not necessary, from
the social point of view, even if it was necessary for _you_, as you
don't work with machines. But I can't help that, and will pay you only
for the socially necessary labor, i.e. 12 marks.' If this is how you
proceed when purchasing boots, you must then pay the socially necessary
costs of maintaining my labor-power when you buy this. Socially
necessary to my labor, however, is everything that in our country and in
the present age is seen as the customary maintenance of a man of my
class. In a word, what you have to pay me is not the physiologically
necessary minimum that barely keeps me alive, as you would give an
animal, but rather the socially customary minimum that ensures my
habitual standard of living. Only then will you have paid the value of
the commodity as an honest purchaser, otherwise you are buying it below
its value."

We see here how the worker is just as much in the right as the
capitalist, simply from the commodity standpoint. But it is only over
time that the worker can get this standpoint accepted -- as a social
class, i.e. as a whole, as organization. Only with the rise of trade
unions and a workers' party does the worker begin to sell his
labor-power at its value, i.e. to insist on maintaining his life as a
social and cultural necessity. Before the appearance of trade unions in
a country, however, and before their acceptance in each particular
branch of industry, what was decisive in determining wages was the
tendency of the capitalist to reduce the means of subsistence to the
physiological minimum, the animal minimum, i.e. to regularly pay for
labor-power below its value. The time of unrestrained rule of capital,
still not meeting any resistance on the part of workers' coalitions and
organization, led to the same barbaric degradation of the working class
in relation to wages as it did in relation to working time before the
introduction of factory legislation. This is a crusade by capital
against any trace of luxury, comfort and convenience in the life of the
worker, as he was accustomed to in the earlier period of handicrafts and
peasant economy. It is an attempt to reduce the worker's consumption to
the simple bare act of supplying the body with a minimum of fodder, in
the way that cattle are fed or machinery is oiled. In this connection,
the lowest and least needy workers are presented to the spoiled worker
as model and example. This crusade against the human maintenance of the
workers began in England -- along with capitalist industry. An English
writer complained in the eighteenth century: "Simply consider the
shocking quantity of superfluities that our manufacturing workers
consume, for example brandy, gin, tea, sugar, foreign fruit, strong
beer, pressed linen, snuff and smoking tobacco, etc." At that time the
French, Dutch and German workers were offered as a model of frugality to
the English workers. An English manufacturer wrote: "Labor is a whole
third more reasonable in France than in England; for the French poor" --
this is how they referred to the workers -- "work hard and are sparing
on food and clothing, their main consumption being bread, vegetables,
roots and dried fish, for they very seldom eat meat, and very little
bread when wheat is dear." Around the beginning of the nineteenth
century, an American, Count [Benjamin Thompson] Rumford, produced a
special "cookbook for workers" with recipes for cheaper food. One recipe
from this famous book, for example, which was accepted with great
enthusiasm by the bourgeoisie of several countries, went: "Five pounds
of barley, five pounds of maize, 30 pfennigs worth of herrings, 10
pfennigs of salt, 10 pfennigs of vinegar, 20 pfennigs of pepper and
vegetables -- total 2.08 marks, provides a soup for sixty-four people,
and with the average price of grain, the cost of food can be reduced to
no more than 3 pfennig per head." Of the workers in the mines of South
America, whose daily work, perhaps the heaviest in the world, consists
in carrying on their shoulders a weight of ore of between 180 and 200
lbs. from a depth of 450 feet, Justus Liebig relates that they live only
on bread and beans. They would prefer just bread as their nourishment,
but their masters, having found that they cannot work so hard on bread,
treat them like horses and force them to eat beans, as beans contribute
more to the building of bones than does bread. In France, the first
hunger revolt of the workers took place already in 1831 -- that of the
silk weavers in Lyon. But capital celebrated its greatest orgies in the
reduction of wages under the Second Empire, in the 1860s, when machine
industry proper took hold in France. The entrepreneurs fled from the
towns to the countryside, where they could find cheaper hands. And they
found women there who would work for one sou a day, about four pfennigs.
But this wonderful state of affairs did not last long, for such a wage
could not sustain even an animal existence. In Germany, capital first
introduced similar conditions in the textile industry, where wages in
the 1840s were driven down even below the physiological minimum, leading
to the hunger revolts of weavers in Silesia and Bohemia. Today the
animal minimum subsistence remains the rule for wages where trade unions
do not have their effect on the standard of living -- for agricultural
workers in Germany, in dressmaking, and in the various branches of
domestic industry.

### 5.4

In ratcheting up the burden of labor and pressing down the living
standard of working people to as near as possible an animal level, if
not sometimes indeed below this, modern capitalist exploitation is
similar to that of the slave and _corvée_ economies at the time of their
worst degeneration, i.e. when each entered its respective phase of
decay. But what capitalist commodity production is unique in having
brought forth, quite unknown in all earlier epochs, is the partial
non-employment and consequent non-consumption of working people as a
constant phenomenon, i.e. the so-called reserve army of labor.
Capitalist production depends on the market and must follow its demand.
This however changes continuously and alternately generates so-called
good and bad years, seasons and months of business. Capital must
continuously adapt to the changing conjuncture, and accordingly employ
either more or fewer workers. It must, accordingly, in order to have to
hand at any time the labor-power needed for even the highest market
demand, constantly keep available in reserve, on top of the workers
actually employed, a considerable number of unemployed. These workers,
not being employed, receive no wage, their labor-power is not bought, it
simply remains in store; the non-consumption of a section of the working
class is thus an essential component of capitalist production's law of
wages. How these unemployed live their life is no concern of capital,
yet capital rebuffs any attempt to abolish the reserve army as a danger
to its own vital interests. A striking example of this was offered by
the English cotton crisis of 1863. When the spinning and weaving mills
of England suddenly had to break off production for want of American raw
cotton, and close to a million of the working population were workless,
a number of these unemployed decided to emigrate to Australia in order
to escape the threat of starvation. They asked the English Parliament to
grant £2 million to facilitate the emigration of 50,000 unemployed
workers. The cotton manufacturers, however, raised a storm of
indignation against this suggestion from the workers. Industry could not
do without machines, and like machines, the workers had to remain
available. "The country" would suffer a loss of £4 million if the
starving unemployed suddenly disappeared. Parliament accordingly refused
the emigration fund, and the unemployed remained chained to the
breadline so as to form the necessary reserve for capital. A still more
dramatic example was offered by the French capitalists in 1871. After
the defeat of the [Paris] Commune, when the butchery of the Paris
workers, in both legal and extra-legal forms, was pursued to such an
enormous degree that tens of thousands of proletarians, including the
best and most capable, the elite of the working class, were murdered,
the satisfied sense of revenge on the part of the entrepreneurs was
punctuated by an unease that a shortage of reserve "hands" might soon be
painfully felt; it was precisely at this time, after the end of the war,
that industry was experiencing a vigorous upswing. Several Paris
entrepreneurs accordingly applied to the courts to have the persecution
of Commune fighters moderated and thus save workers from military
butchers for the army of capital.

For capital, however, the reserve army has a dual function: first, to
supply labor-power for every sudden upswing in business, and second, to
exert a constant pressure on the active workforce by competition from
the unemployed, and so reduce their wages to a minimum.

Marx distinguished four different strata in the reserve army, with
differing functions for capital and its conditions of existence. The
topmost stratum is the periodically inactive industrial workers, who are
present in all trades, even the best-situated ones. Their members
constantly change, as every worker is unemployed at certain times and
active in others; their numbers also fluctuate sharply with the course
of business, becoming very high in times of crisis and low at the peak
of the cycle; but they never disappear, and generally increase with the
progress of industrial development. The second stratum are the unskilled
proletarians who flood into the towns from the country, who appear on
the labor market with the lowest demands, and as simple workers are not
tied to any definite branch of industry, but are ready for employment in
any branch as a reservoir. The third category is the lower order of
proletarians, who have no regular employment and are constantly looking
for one kind of casual labor or another. Here we find the longest
working time and the lowest wages, and for this reason this stratum is
quite as useful for capital, and as directly indispensable, as the
former categories. This stratum is constantly recruited from the surplus
numbers in industry and agriculture, but particularly from small-scale
artisans who go under and from dying trades. It forms the broad basis
for domestic industry, and acts as it were behind the scenes, behind the
official showground of industry. And here it not only has no tendency to
disappear, but actually grows both by the increasing effects of industry
in town and country, and by the greatest production of children.

Finally, the fourth stratum of the proletarian reserve army are the
direct paupers, the recognized poor, some of them capable of work, who
in times when industry and trade are good are to a certain extent taken
on, being then the first to be dismissed in times of crisis; others are
incapable of work: older workers whom industry can no longer use,
proletarian widows, orphans and pauper children, crippled and mutilated
victims of large-scale industry, mining, etc., and finally those
unaccustomed to work: vagabonds and the like. This stratum merges
directly with the lumpenproletariat: criminals and prostitutes.
Pauperism, Marx said, is the disability home for the working class and
the dead weight of its reserve army. Its existence follows just as
necessarily and unavoidably from the reserve army as the reserve army
does from the development of industry. Poverty and the lumpenproletariat
are part of the conditions of existence of capitalism and grow together
with it; the greater is social wealth, functioning capital, and the mass
of workers employed by it, the greater too is the available stratum of
unemployed, the reserve army; and the greater the reserve army in
relation to the mass of employed workers, the greater is the lowest
stratum of poverty, pauperism and crime. The number of unemployed and
unwaged thus grows unavoidably along with capital and wealth, and so
does the beggared stratum of the working class -- official poverty.
"_This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation_," wrote
Marx.

The formation of a constant and growing stratum of unemployed was, as we
said, unknown in all earlier forms of society. In the primitive
communist community, it goes without saying that everyone works to the
extent that is necessary to maintain their life, partly from immediate
need, and partly under the pressure of the moral and legal authority of
the tribe, the community. But _all_ members of society are also provided
with the available means to live. The standard of living of the
primitive communist group is certainly quite low and simple, the
conveniences of life are primitive. But to the extent that the means for
life do exist, they are present equally for all, and poverty in the
present-day sense, deprivation of the existing social resources, is at
this time quite unknown. The primitive tribe sometimes goes hungry --
even often, if it suffers from unfavorable natural conditions -- but its
lack is then the lack of society as such, whereas lack on the part of
some members of society at the same time as a surplus is available for
others, is something unthinkable; to the extent that the society's means
of subsistence are ensured on the whole, so is the existence of each
individual.

In Oriental and antique slavery we see the same thing. No matter how the
Egyptian state slave or the Greek private slave was exploited and
overworked, no matter how great the distance between his bare
maintenance and the excess of the master might have been, his
maintenance was at least ensured for him by the slave relationship.
Slaves were not allowed to die of hunger, any more than a horse or a cow
is today. It was the same with the _corvée_ relationship of the Middle
Ages: the chaining of the peasantry to the soil, and the solid
construction of the whole feudal system of dependence, in which everyone
had to be lord over others, or the servant of a lord, or both at once --
this system ascribed everyone a definite place. No matter how bad the
squeezing of the serfs might be, no lord had the right to drive them
from the soil, i.e. rob them of their means of subsistence; on the
contrary, the serf relationship obliged the lord in cases of distress,
such as fire, flood, hail, etc., to support the impoverished peasants.
It was only when the Middle Ages came to an end, with the collapse of
feudalism and the entry of modern capital, that expropriation of peasant
land got under way. In the Middle Ages, however, the existence of the
great mass of working people was fully secured. To some extent, already
at this time, a small contingent of paupers and beggars emerged as a
result of the countless wars or of individual loss. But it was a duty of
society to maintain these poor. Emperor Charlemagne already laid down
expressly in his capitularies, "As for the beggars who wander around the
countryside, we desire that each of our vassals should feed the poor,
whether on the estate enfeoffed to him or within his house, and he
should not allow them to go and beg elsewhere." Later, it was a special
vocation of monasteries to lodge the poor, and to provide them with work
if they were capable of this. In the Middle Ages, therefore, any needy
person was sure of reception in any house, the feeding of those without
means was seen as a simple duty, and was in no way linked with the
stigma of contempt faced by a beggar today.

Past history knows only one case where a large stratum of the population
was left unoccupied and workless. This is the already mentioned case of
the ancient Roman peasantry, who were driven off the land and
transformed into a proletariat, with no work to do. This
proletarianization of the peasantry was of course a logical and
necessary consequence of the development of great latifundia, along with
the spread of the slave economy. But it was in no way necessary for the
existence of the slave economy and large landed property. On the
contrary, the unemployed Roman proletariat was simply a misfortune, a
pure burden on society, and this society tried all available means to
control the proletariat and its poverty, by periodic distributions of
land, by distribution of foodstuffs, by organizing an immense food
import and by subsidizing the price of grain. In the end, this great
proletariat in ancient Rome was simply maintained by the state.

Capitalist commodity production, accordingly, is the first economic form
in the history of humanity in which the lack of occupation and resources
of a large and growing stratum of the population, and the direct and
hopeless poverty of another stratum, is not simply a result of this
economy but also a necessity for it, a condition of its existence.
Insecurity of existence for the entire working mass, and chronic lack,
in part direct poverty, of broad strata, are for the first time a normal
social phenomenon. And the scholars of the bourgeoisie, who cannot
imagine any other form of society than today's, are so imbued with the
natural necessity of this stratum of unemployed and workless that they
explain it as a natural law intended by God. The Englishman Malthus, at
the beginning of the nineteenth century, constructed on this basis his
celebrated theory of overpopulation, according to which poverty develops
because humanity has the evil habit of multiplying children more quickly
than means of subsistence.

As we have seen, however, it is nothing else than the simple effect of
commodity production and exchange that led to these results. The law of
commodities, which rests formally on complete equality and freedom,
produces by iron necessity, without any intervention of statute or
force, a glaring social inequality such as was unknown in all earlier
conditions based on the direct rule of one person over another. For the
first time now, direct hunger becomes a scourge inflicted daily on the
life of the working masses. And this is also explained as a law of
nature. The Anglican parson [Joseph] Townsend wrote as far back as 1786:

>It seems to be a law of Nature that the poor should be to a certain
>degree improvident, that there may always be some to fulfill the most
>servile, the most sordid, and the most ignoble offices in the
>community. The stock of human happiness is thereby much increased,
>whilst the more delicate are not only relieved from drudgery ... but
>are left at liberty without interruption to pursue those callings which
>are suited to their various dispositions ... [The Poor Law] tends to
>destroy the harmony and beauty, the symmetry and order of that system
>which God and Nature have established in the world.

The "more delicate," who live at the cost of others, had already seen
the finger of God and a law of nature in every social form that secured
them the joys of the exploiting life. Even the great minds of the past
did not escape this historical deception. Two thousand years before the
English parson, the great Greek thinker Aristotle wrote:

>It is nature itself that has created slavery. Animals are divided into
>males and females. The male is a more perfect animal, and rules; the
>female is less perfect, and obeys. Similarly there are in the human
>race individuals that stand as much below others as the body stands
>below the soul or the animal below man; these are creatures that are
>fit only for physical work and are unfit to produce anything more
>perfect. These individuals are destined by nature for slavery, since
>there is nothing better for them than to obey others ... Does there
>exist so great a difference between the slave and the animal? Their
>works are similar, they are useful to us only by way of their body. We
>conclude from these principles, therefore, that nature has created
>certain men for freedom and others for slavery, and that it is
>accordingly useful and right that there should be slaves.

"Nature," which is made responsible for every form of exploitation, must
at all events have acquired a rather jaded taste over time. For even if
it might still be worthwhile to demean a large mass of people with the
shame of slavery, in order to raise a free people of philosophers and
geniuses like Aristotle on their backs, the demeaning of millions of
proletarians today to support vulgar factory-owners and fat parsons is a
less attractive goal.

### 5.5

We have examined up till now what standard of living the capitalist
commodity economy provides for the working class and its various strata.
But we still know nothing precise as to the relationship between this
living standard of the workers and social wealth in general. The workers
may in one case, for example, have more means of subsistence, more
nourishing food and better clothing than before, but if the wealth of
the other classes has grown still more rapidly, then the _share_ of the
workers in the social product has grown smaller. The living standard of
the workers in itself, in absolute terms, may thus rise, while their
share relative to other classes falls. The living standard of each
individual and each class, however, can only be correctly judged if the
conditions of the particular time and the other strata of the same
society are taken into account. The prince of a primitive, half-savage
or barbaric African tribe has a lower standard of living, i.e. a simpler
dwelling, poorer clothing, cruder food, than an average factory worker
in Germany. But this prince lives in a "princely" fashion in comparison
with the means and demands of his tribe, whereas the factory worker in
Germany lives very poorly, compared with the luxury of the rich
bourgeoisie and the needs of the present day. In order therefore to
judge correctly the position of the workers in the present society, it
is necessary not only to examine absolute wages, but also relative
wages, i.e. the share that the worker's wage makes up out of the total
product of his labor. We assumed in our earlier example that the worker
had to work the first six hours out of an eleven-hour working day in
order to cover his wage, i.e. his means of subsistence, and then spend
five hours creating surplus value for the capitalist for free. We
assumed in this example, therefore, that the production of means of
subsistence for the worker cost six hours' labor. We also saw how the
capitalist seeks by all means to press down the living standard of the
worker, to expand to the maximum the unpaid labor, surplus value. But
let us assume that the worker's living standard does not change, i.e.
that he is still in the position to obtain the same quantities of food,
clothing, linen, furniture, etc. We assume, therefore, that there is no
reduction in wages in absolute terms. If however the production of all
these means of subsistence becomes cheaper, as a result of advances in
production, and requires therefore less time, then the worker will spend
a shorter time covering his wage. Let us assume that the quantity of
food, clothing, furniture, etc. that the worker needs per day no longer
demands six hours' labor but only five. Then the worker will not spend
six hours out of his eleven-hour day replacing his wage, but only five
hours, and he will have six hours remaining for unpaid labor, for the
creation of surplus value for the capitalist. The share of the worker in
his produce has been reduced by one-sixth, while the share of the
capitalist has grown by one-fifth. There has however been no reduction
in the absolute wage. It may even come about that the living standard of
the workers is increased, i.e. that absolute wages rise, let us say by
10 percent, and indeed not just in money terms, but also the actual
means of subsistence of the workers. But if the productivity of labor
has risen in the same time by some 15 percent, then the share of the
workers in the product, i.e. their relative wage, has actually fallen,
despite the rise in absolute wages. The share of the worker in the
product thus depends on the productivity of labor. The less labor it
takes to produce his means of subsistence, the smaller his relative
wage. If the shirts that he wears, his boots and his caps, are produced
with less labor than before, due to advances in manufacture, then he may
obtain with his wage the same quantity of shirts, boots and caps with
his wage, but at the same time he now receives a smaller share of the
social wealth, the total social product. The daily consumption of the
worker, however, is made up of the same quantities of all the different
products and raw materials. Not only do [advances in] shirt manufacture
cheapen the worker's maintenance, but likewise in the cotton manufacture
that supplies material for his shirts, the machine industry that
supplies sewing machines, and the yarn industry that supplies yarn.
Similarly, the worker's provisions are made cheaper not only by advances
in baking, but also by American agriculture that supplies grain on a
massive scale, by advances in railways and steam shipping that bring
this American grain to Europe, and so on. Every advance in industry,
every increase in the productivity of human labor, makes the maintenance
of the workers cost ever less labor. The worker need therefore spend an
ever smaller part of his working day on replacing his wage, and the part
in which he creates unpaid labor, surplus value for the capitalist,
becomes every greater.

But the constant and ceaseless progress of technology is a necessity for
capitalism, a condition of its very existence. Competition between
individual entrepreneurs forces each of them to produce their product as
cheaply as possible, i.e. with the greatest possible saving on human
labor. And if any one capitalist introduces a new and improved process
into his own factory, this competition forces all other entrepreneurs in
the same branch of production to improve their technology in the same
way, so as not to be driven from the field, i.e. the commodity market.
The visible outward form of this is the general introduction of machine
power in place of manual, and the ever more rapid introduction of new
and improved machines in place of old. Technical inventions in all areas
of production have become a daily occurrence. The technical
transformation of all industry, not only in production itself but also
in means of communication, is an incessant phenomenon, a vital law of
capitalist commodity production. And every advance in labor productivity
is expressed in a reduction in the amount of labor needed to maintain
the worker. In other words, capitalist production cannot take a single
step forward without reducing the share of the workers in the social
product. With each new technological invention, each improvement of
machinery, each new application of steam and electricity to production
and communications, the share of the worker in the product grows smaller
and the share of the capitalist larger. Relative wages steadily fall
lower and lower, without pause or interruption, while surplus value,
i.e. the unpaid wealth of the capitalists squeezed out of the worker,
grows just as steadily and constantly higher and higher.

We see here again a striking difference between capitalist commodity
production and all earlier forms of society. In the primitive communist
society, as we know, the product is distributed equally, directly after
production, to everyone who works, i.e. to all members of society, as
there is practically no one who does not work. Feudal relations are
governed not by equality but by the exploitation of workers by
non-workers. But it is not the share of the worker, i.e. the _corvée_
peasant, that is determined by the fruit of his labor, rather the share
of the exploiter, the feudal lord, that is fixed in terms of the
definite dues and fees that he receives from the peasant. What remains
over in working time and product is the share of the peasant, so that in
normal conditions, before the extreme degeneration of serfdom, he has to
a large extent the possibility of increasing his own share by exerting
more labor-power. Of course, this share of the peasant was steadily
reduced by the growing demands of the nobles and clergy for services and
fees, over the course of the Middle Ages. But it was always definite,
visible norms laid down by men, no matter how arbitrarily they were
established, that determined the respective shares of the product of the
_corvée_ peasant and his feudal leech. For this reason, the medieval
_corvée_ peasant or serf could perceive and feel exactly when greater
burdens were imposed on him and his own share was stinted. It was
possible therefore to struggle against the reduction of this share, and
such struggle broke out, when external conditions made this possible, as
an open struggle of the exploited peasant against the curtailing of his
share in the product of his labor. In certain conditions, this struggle
was actually successful: the freedom of the urban burghers precisely
arose by the way that the former bonded artisans gradually shook off the
various _corvées_ -- Kurmeden, Besthaupt, Gewandrecht, and the thousand
other ways of bleeding of the feudal age -- one after another, until
they conquered the rest -- political freedom -- by open struggle.

In the wage system there are no legal or customary determinations of the
share of the worker in his product, not even arbitrary and forcible
ones. This share is determined by the degree of productivity of labor at
the time, by the level of technology; it is not the caprice of the
exploiter but the progress of technology that steadily and relentlessly
reduces the share of the worker. It is then a completely invisible
power, a simple mechanical effect of competition and commodity
production, that seizes from the worker an ever greater portion of his
product and leaves him an ever smaller one, a power that has its effects
silently and unnoticeably behind the back of the workers, and against
which no struggle is therefore possible. The personal role of the
exploiter is still visible, whenever it is a question of the absolute
wage, i.e. the actual standard of living. A reduction in wages that
brings about a suppression of the actual living standard of the workers
is a visible attack by the capitalists on the workers, and it is
generally countered by immediate struggle when trade unions exist, in
favorable cases even successfully. The fall in relative wages, in
contrast to this, seemingly occurs without the least personal
participation of the capitalist, and within the wage system, i.e. on the
basis of commodity production, the workers have no possibility of
struggle and defence against it. Workers cannot struggle against
technical advances in production, against inventions, the introduction
of machinery, against steam and electricity, against improvements in
means of communication. The effect of all these advances on the relative
wage of the workers thus follows quite mechanically from commodity
production and the commodity character of labor-power. This is why even
the most powerful trade unions are quite impotent against this tendency
to a rapid fall in relative wages. The struggle against the fall in
relative wages accordingly means also a struggle against the commodity
character of labor-power, i.e. against capitalist production as a whole.
The struggle against a decline in relative wages is thus no longer a
struggle on the basis of the commodity economy, but rather a
revolutionary, subversive initiative against the existence of this
economy, it is the socialist movement of the proletariat.

This explains the sympathies of the capitalist class for trade unions,
which they originally fought furiously against, once the socialist
struggle has begun -- at least in so far as trade unions allow
themselves be opposed to socialism. In France, all struggles of the
workers to obtain the right of combination were in vain until the 1870s,
and trade unions pursued with draconian penalties. Soon after, however,
once the Commune uprising had put the whole bourgeoisie into a mad fear
of the red specter, a sudden sharp transformation in public opinion
began. The personal organ of President [Léon] Gambetta, La République
française, and the whole ruling party of "satisfied republicans," began
to praise the trade-union movement, even to propagate it eagerly. In the
early nineteenth century, the restrained German workers were pointed out
to the English workers as a model, whereas today it is the English
worker, and not even the restrained ones but the "covetous"
beefsteak-eating trade unionist, who is recommended to the German worker
as a model to follow. So true is it that the bourgeoisie finds even the
most bitter struggle to increase the absolute wage of the workers a
harmless triviality compared with an attack on what is most sacred to it
-- the mechanical law of capitalism to constantly suppress the relative
wage.

### 5.6

Only if we bring together all the results of the wage relationship
presented above, can we understand the capitalist law of wages that
governs the material condition of life of the worker. What is most
important is to distinguish absolute from relative wages. The absolute
wage, for its part, appears in a double guise: first as a sum of money,
i.e. the nominal wage, and second as a sum of means of subsistence that
the worker can buy for this money, i.e. the real wage. The worker's
monetary wage may remain constant or even rise, while his living
standard, i.e. the real wage, falls at the same time. The real wage has
the constant tendency to fall to the absolute minimum, the minimum of
physical existence, in other words there is a constant tendency on the
part of capital to pay for labor-power _below_ its value. Only workers'
organization provides a counterweight to this tendency of capital. The
main function of the trade unions is that, by increasing the needs of
the workers, by elevating their habits, they create in place of the
physical minimum existence a cultural social minimum, below which wages
cannot be reduced without immediately provoking a collective struggle in
defense. The great economic significance of Social Democracy, too, is
particularly that by stirring the broad masses of workers intellectually
and politically, it raises their cultural level and with it their
economic needs. When such things as subscribing to a newspaper or buying
pamphlets become part of a worker's everyday habits, his economic
maintenance rises, and correspondingly so do wages. The effect of Social
Democracy in this respect is a double one, if the trade unions of the
country in question maintain an open alliance with Social Democracy,
since opposition to Social Democracy drives even bourgeois strata to
found competing unions, which in their turn carry the educational effect
of organization and the rise in cultural level to broader strata of the
proletariat. We see, therefore, how in Germany, besides the free trade
unions that are allied with Social Democracy, a number of Christian,
Catholic and secular trade-union associations are also active. The
situation is similar in France, where so-called yellow trade unions were
founded to combat the socialist unions, while in Russia the most violent
outbreaks of the present revolutionary mass strike began with the
"yellow" unions quiescent towards the government. In England, however,
where the trade unions keep their distance from socialism, the
bourgeoisie do not bother to spread the idea of combination in
proletarian milieus.

The trade union thus plays an indispensable organic role in the modern
wage system. It is only through the union that labor-power as a
commodity is placed in a position where it can be sold at its value. The
capitalist law of value, in relation to labor-power, is not abolished by
the trade unions, as [Ferdinand] Lassalle misguidedly assumed; on the
contrary, it is only by their action that it is realized. The systematic
giveaway price at which the capitalist seeks to buy labor-power is
increasingly replaced by a more or less real price thanks to union
action.

This function of theirs, however, is performed by the trade unions in
the context of the pressure of the mechanical laws of capitalist
production, first of all the constant reserve army of inactive workers,
and second, the constant fluctuations of the trade cycle up and down.
Both laws impose limits to the effect of trade unions that cannot be
overcome. The constant change in the industrial trade cycle forces the
unions, with every decline, to defend existing achievements from new
attacks by capital, and with every upswing, once again to raise the
level of wages that had been reduced back up to the level corresponding
to the new situation. In this way, the unions are always placed on the
defensive. The industrial reserve army of unemployed, however, puts what
could be called spatial limits on the effect of the unions: only the
upper stratum of the most well-situated workers are accessible to their
organization and effects, those for whom unemployment is only periodic,
"abnormal" as Marx put it. The lowest stratum of unskilled rural
proletarians, on the other hand, constantly flooding into the town from
the countryside, as well as from the various semi-rural irregular trades
such as brickmaking and digging, are by the very spatial and temporal
conditions of their occupation, as well as by their social milieu, less
amenable to trade-union organization. Finally, the broad lower stratum
of the reserve army: the unemployed with irregular occupation, domestic
industry, as well as the sporadically employed poor, fall completely
outside all organization. In general, the greater the need and pressure
in a stratum of the proletariat, the less the possibility of trade-union
influence. Trade-union action, accordingly, is very weak in the depths
of the proletariat, while it is strong in the breadth -- i.e. even if
unions cover only a part of the topmost stratum of the proletariat,
their influence extends to the whole stratum, as their achievements
benefit the whole mass of workers employed in the trades in question.
Trade-union action, in fact, leads to a stronger differentiation within
the proletariat as a whole, by raising out of misery the upper advance
detachment of industrial workers, those capable of organization,
bringing them together and consolidating them. The gulf between the
upper stratum of the working class and the lower strata thereby becomes
that much greater. In no country is it as great as in England, where the
additional cultural effect of Social Democracy on the lower strata,
those less capable of organization, is absent, in contrast to the
situation in Germany.

It is quite wrong in depicting capitalist wage relationships to focus
only on the wages actually paid to industrial workers in employment, a
habit of the bourgeoisie and its paid writers that has unfortunately
been generally adopted even by the workers themselves. The entire
reserve army of unemployed, from the occasionally unemployed skilled
workers down to the deepest poverty and official pauperism, is a
necessary factor in determining the wage relationships. The lowest
strata of the needy and excluded who are employed only to a small extent
or not at all, are not as it were a scum that does not form part of
"official society," as the bourgeoisie very understandably present them,
but are connected with the topmost, best-situated stratum of industrial
workers by a whole series of intermediate steps. This inner connection
is shown numerically by the sudden growth in the lower strata of the
reserve army that occurs every time that business is bad, and the
corresponding contraction at the peak of the business cycle, as well as
by the relative decline in the number of those who resort to public
assistance with the development of the class struggle and the related
rise in self-consciousness of the mass of proletarians. And finally,
every industrial worker who is crippled at work or has the misfortune of
being sixty years old, has a fifty-fifty chance of falling into the
lower stratum of bitter poverty, the "beggary stratum" of the
proletariat. The living conditions of the lowest strata of the
proletariat thus follow the same laws of capitalist production, pulled
up and down, and the proletariat, along with the broad stratum of rural
workers, the army of unemployed, and all strata from the very top to the
very bottom, forms an organic whole, a social class, whose varying
graduations of need and oppression can only be correctly grasped by the
capitalist law of wages as a whole. Finally, however, no more than half
of the law of wages is grasped if just the movement in absolute wages is
taken into account. Only the law of automatic decline in relative wages
that follows from the increase in labor productivity displays the
capitalist law of wages in its full scope.

The observation that workers' wages have the tendency on average to
stand at the minimum necessary means of subsistence, was made already in
the eighteenth century by the French and English founders of bourgeois
political economy. But they explained the mechanism by which this
minimum wage was governed in a peculiar manner, i.e. by fluctuations in
the supply of hands seeking work. If the workers obtain higher wages
than are absolutely necessary for life, these learned men declared, then
they marry more and bring more children into the world. In this way, the
labor market becomes so overfilled again that it far surpasses the
demands of capital. Capital then presses wages sharply down, taking
advantage of the great competition among workers. But if wages do not
suffice for the necessary maintenance of life, then workers die off on a
massive scale, and their ranks are thinned out until only so many remain
as capital has a need for, with the result that wages again rise. By
this pendulum between excessive proliferation and excessive mortality in
the working class, wages are always brought back again to the minimum
means of subsistence. This theory, which prevailed in political economy
until the 1860s, was taken over by Lassalle, who called it a "merciless
iron law" ...

The weaknesses of this theory are quite evident today, with the full
development of capitalist production. Large-scale industry, with its
feverish pace of business and competition, cannot wait to reduce wages
until workers first marry too often, then have too many children, then
until these children grow up and appear on the labor market, before it
finds the over-supply it desires. The movement of wages, corresponding
to the rhythm of industry, does not have the comfortable motion of a
pendulum whose swing takes a generation, i.e. twenty-five years; wages
are rather in a ceaseless vibrating motion, so that neither can the
procreation of the working class govern the level of wages, nor can
industry with its demand for the procreation of workers. Secondly, the
industrial labor market is generally determined in its extent not by the
natural procreation of the workers, but rather by the constant influx of
freshly proletarianized strata from the countryside, from handicrafts
and small-scale industry, as well as that of the workers' own wives and
children. The over-supply of the labor market, in the form of the
reserve army, is a constant phenomenon of modern industry and a
condition of its existence. So it is not a change in the supply of
labor-power, not the movement of the working class that is decisive for
the level of wages, but rather change in the demand from capital, _its_
movement. A surplus of the commodity labor-power always exists in
reserve, and its payment is better or worse according to whether capital
moves to strongly absorb labor-power at the peak of the business cycle
or to expel it again on a massive scale in the commotion of economic
crisis.

The mechanism of the law of wages is thus quite different from how it
was assumed by bourgeois political economy, and also by Lassalle. The
result, however, i.e. the pattern of wage relations that actually arises
from this, is still worse than it was according to that old assumption.
The capitalist law of wages is certainly not an "iron" law, but it is
still more relentless and terrible, being an "elastic" law that seeks to
press the wages of employed workers down to the minimum in terms of
means of subsistence, by simultaneously keeping a whole large stratum of
unemployed squirming on a thin elastic tightrope between existence and
non-existence.

The positing of the "iron law of wages" with its provocative
revolutionary character was possible only at the beginnings of political
economy, in its youthful years. From the moment that Lassalle made this
law the axis of his political agitation in Germany, the lackeys of
bourgeois political economy hastened to conjure away the iron law of
wages, condemning it as a false and erroneous doctrine. A whole pack of
regular paid agents of the manufacturers, such as [Léon] Faucher,
[Hermann] Schulze von Delitzsch and Max Wirth, launched a crusade
against Lassalle and the iron law of wages, in which connection they
recklessly smeared their own predecessors: Adam Smith, Ricardo, and the
other great creators of bourgeois political economy. Once Marx had shown
the elastic character of the capitalist law of wages, under the effect
of the industrial reserve army, in 1867, bourgeois political economy
finally went silent. Today, the official professorial science of the
bourgeoisie has no law of wages at all, preferring to avoid this tricky
subject and simply advance incoherent babbling about the lamentable
character of unemployment and the usefulness of moderate and modest
trade unions.

We have the same comedy in relation to the other major question of
political economy, i.e. how is capitalist profit created, where does it
come from? Just as on the subject of the share of the worker in the
wealth of society, so on that of the capitalist, too, the first
scientific answer was given already by the founders of political economy
in the eighteenth century. This theory was given its clearest form by
David Ricardo, who clearly and logically explained the profit of the
capitalist as the unpaid labor of the proletariat.

### 5.7

In our consideration of the law of value, we started with the purchase
and sale of the commodity labor-power. This already requires, however, a
proletarian wage-worker without means of production, and a capitalist
who possesses these on a sufficient scale to found a modern enterprise.
How did these emerge on the commodity market? In our earlier
presentation, we had only commodity producers in view, i.e. people with
their own means of production, who themselves produce commodities for
sale. How could capital on the one hand, and a complete lack of means on
the other, arise on the basis of the exchange of equal commodity values?
We have now seen that the purchase of the commodity labor-power, even at
its full value, leads, when this commodity is put to use, to the
formation of unpaid labor or surplus value, i.e. of capital. The
formation of capital and inequality thus becomes clear, once we consider
wage-labor and its effects. But this means that capital and proletarians
must already be in existence! The question therefore is, how and from
what did the first proletarians and the first capitalists arises, how
was the first leap made from simple commodity production to capitalist
production? In other words, how did the transition take place from
small-scale medieval handicrafts to modern capitalism?

As to the rise of the first modern proletariat, the answer is given by
the history of the dissolution of feudalism. In order for a worker to
appear on the market, he had to have obtained personal freedom. The
first precondition for this was therefore emancipation from serfdom and
forced labor. But he also had to have lost all means of production. This
was brought about by the massive "enclosure," through which the
landholding nobility formed their present estates at the dawn of the
modern age. Peasants by the thousands were driven from the land they had
possessed for centuries, and communal peasant lands taken over by the
lords. The English nobility, for example, did this when the expansion of
trade in the Middle Ages, and the blossoming of wool manufacture in
Flanders, made the raising of sheep for the wool industry a profitable
business. In order to transform fields into sheep-walks, the peasants
were simply driven off the land. These "enclosures" in England lasted
from the fifteenth century through to the nineteenth. In the years
1814-20, for example, on the estates of the Duchess of Sutherland, no
less than 15,000 inhabitants were evicted, their villages burned down
and their fields converted into meadows, on which 131,000 sheep were
kept instead of peasants. In Germany, a notion of how this violent
manufacture of "free" proletarians out of banished peasants was
accomplished by the Prussian nobility, is given by [Wilhelm] Wolff's
pamphlet _Die schlesische Millliarde_ [The Silesian Billion]. These
peasants, deprived of their existence, had nothing left but the freedom
either to starve or to sell themselves, free as they were, for a hunger
wage.

## 6. The tendencies of the capitalist economy

### 6.1

We have seen how commodity production arose in the wake of the
step-by-step dissolution of all forms of society with a definite planned
organization of production -- the primitive communist society, the slave
economy, the medieval _corvée_ economy. We have also seen how the
present-day capitalist economy emerged out of simple commodity economy,
urban artisanal production, quite mechanically at the end of the Middle
Ages, i.e. without human will and consciousness. We initially posed the
question: _how is the capitalist economy possible_? This is indeed the
fundamental question of political economy as a science. And this science
supplies us with an adequate answer. It shows how the capitalist
economy, which in view of its total lack of planning, its lack of any
conscious organization, is at first sight something impossible, an
inextricable puzzle, can nevertheless exist and function as a whole.
This happens:

* By commodity exchange and the money economy, whereby all individual
  producers, and the most remote regions of the earth, are economically
  linked together, and a division of labor accomplished that spans the
  world;
* By free competition, which ensures technological progress and at the
  same time constantly transforms small producers into wage workers,
  whereby capital is supplied with purchasable labor-power;
* By the capitalist law of value, which on the one hand automatically
  takes care that wage workers never rise up from the proletarian state
  and escape labor under the command of capital, while on the other hand
  making possible an ever greater accumulation of unpaid labor into
  capital, and thereby ever greater concentration and extension of means
  of production;
* By the industrial reserve army, which provides capitalist production
  with a capacity for extension and adaptation to the needs of society;
* By equalization of the rate of profit, which governs the constant
  movement of capital from one branch of production into another, and
  thus regulates the balance of the division of labor; and finally
* By price fluctuations and crises, which in part daily, and in part
  periodically, lead to a balance between blind and chaotic production,
  and the needs of society.

In this way, by the mechanical effect of the above economic laws, the
capitalist economy arose and exists entirely by itself, without any
conscious intervention of society. In other words, it becomes possible
in this way, despite the lack of any organized economic connection
between the individual producers, despite the complete planlessness in
people's economic activity, for social production and its circuit with
consumption to proceed, for the great mass of society to be put to work,
the needs of society to be met one way or another, and economic
progress, the development of the productivity of human labor, to be
secured as the foundation of the progress of culture as a whole.

These however are the fundamental conditions for the existence of any
human society, and as long as an economic form that has developed
historically satisfies these conditions, it can claim to be a historical
necessity.

Social conditions, however, are not rigid and immovable forms. We have
seen how in the course of time they undergo many alterations, how they
are subject to constant change, in which the progress of human culture
beats a path for development. The long millennia of the primitive
communist economy, which led human society from its first origins in a
semi-animal existence to a high level of cultural development, with the
construction of language and religion, stock-raising and agriculture,
sedentary life and the formation of villages, is followed by the gradual
demolition of primitive communism and the construction of antique
slavery, which in turn brings with it major new advances in social life,
to end again with the decline of the antique world. On the ruins of the
antique world, the communist society of the Germanic peoples was the
point of departure for a new form -- the _corvée_ economy, on which
medieval feudalism was based.

Once again, development follows its uninterrupted course. In the womb of
feudal society, germs of a completely new economic and social form arise
in the towns, with the formation of guild handicrafts, commodity
production and regular trade; it collapses and makes way for capitalist
production, which arises out of artisanal commodity production thanks to
world trade, the discovery of America and of the sea route to India.

The capitalist mode of production, for its part, is already right from
the start, viewed in the quite immense perspective of historical
progress, not something inalterable that exists forever; it is simply a
transitional phase, a rung on the colossal ladder of human cultural
development, in the same way as previous social forms. And indeed, the
development of capitalism itself, on closer inspection, leads on to its
own decline and beyond. If we have up to now investigated the
connections that make the capitalist economy _possible_, it is now time
to familiarize ourselves with those that make it _impossible_. For this,
we need to trace the specific internal laws of capitalist supremacy in
their further effect. It is these very laws that at a certain level of
development turn against all the fundamental conditions without which
human society cannot exist. What particularly distinguishes the
capitalist mode of production from all its predecessors is that it has
the inherent impetus to extend automatically across the whole of the
earth, and drive out all other earlier social orders. In the time of
primitive communism, the whole world accessible to historical research
was likewise covered with communist economies. But between individual
communist communities and tribes there were scarcely any connections, or
only weak ones between neighboring communities. Every such community or
tribe lived a life closed in on itself, and if for example we find such
striking facts as that the medieval Germanic communist community and the
ancient Peruvian community in South America were almost identical, the
"_mark_" in one being the "_marca_" in the other, this circumstance
remains for us an unexplained puzzle, if not mere chance. At the time of
the spread of ancient slavery, too, we find greater or lesser
_similarity_ in the organization and relations of individual slave
economies and states of antiquity, but no common economic life between
them. In the same way, the history of guild handicraft and its
emancipation was repeated in more or less the same way in most towns of
medieval Italy, Germany, France, Holland, England, etc., but for the
most part the history of each town was a separate one.

Capitalist production extends itself to all countries, not just giving
them a similar economic form, but linking them into a single great
capitalist world economy.

Within each European industrial country, capitalist production
ceaselessly drives out petty trade, handicraft and small peasant
production. At the same time it draws all backward European countries,
and all the lands of America, Asia, Africa and Australia, into the world
economy. This happens in two ways: by world trade and by colonial
conquests. Both began together with the discovery of America at the end
of the fifteenth century, extended further in the course of the
following centuries, and particularly in the nineteenth century
experienced the greatest upswing and spread ever more widely. World
trade and colonial conquest go hand in hand in the following way. First
of all they bring the capitalist industrial countries of Europe into
contact with forms of society of all kinds across the world that are
based on earlier cultural and economic stages: peasant, slave economy,
feudal _corvée_, but above all primitive communist. By drawing these
into trade, they are rapidly shaken and destroyed. By the foundation of
colonial trading companies abroad, or by direct conquest, the land, and
the most important foundation of production such as cattle where these
are present, come into the hands of European states or trading
companies. In this way, the indigenous social relations and mode of
economy of native peoples are everywhere destroyed, whole peoples partly
eradicated, partly proletarianized and placed under the command of
industrial and commercial capital as slaves or wage-laborers in one form
or another. The history of colonial wars lasting decades runs right
through the nineteenth century: uprisings against France, Italy, England
and Germany in Africa, against France, England, Holland and the United
States in Asia, against Spain and France in America -- a long and
stubborn resistance by the old indigenous societies against their
destruction and proletarianization by modern capital, a struggle in
which eventually capital everywhere triumphs in the end.

First of all, this means a tremendous extension of the realm of capital,
the construction of a world market and world economy, in which all
inhabited lands of the earth are reciprocally producers and customers
for products, working integrally together and participating in one and
the same earth-spanning economy.

The other side, however, is the advancing immiseration of ever greater
circles of humanity around the globe, and the increasing uncertainty of
their existence. To the extent that in place of old communistic, peasant
or _corvée_ relations, with their limited productive powers and low
standard of living, but with firm and secure conditions of existence for
all, there appear capitalist colonial relations, proletarianization and
wage-slavery, all the peoples affected in America, Asia, Africa and
Australia come to experience bare misery, an unknown and unbearable
burden of labor, and finally complete insecurity of existence. After
fertile and rich Brazil had been transformed for the needs of European
and North American capitalism into a gigantic wasteland of monotonous
coffee plantations, and the indigenous people en masse into
proletarianized wage-slaves on these plantations, these wage-slaves were
suddenly exposed to a purely capitalist phenomenon: the so-called
"coffee crisis," resulting in long-term unemployment and naked hunger.
The rich and immense subcontinent of India was subjected by English
colonial policy to the rule of capital after decades of desperate
resistance, and since this time famine and typhus have been periodic
guests in the Ganges region, to which millions have succumbed. In
central Africa, English and German colonial policy over the last twenty
years has transformed whole populations into wage-slaves and starved
others, their bones lying scattered everywhere. The desperate revolts
and famines in the Chinese empire are the result of the crushing of the
old peasant and artisan economy of this country by the entry of European
capital. The arrival of European capitalism in North America was
accompanied first by the extermination of the indigenous Amerindian
population and the theft of their lands by English emigrants, then by
the establishment at the start of the nineteenth century of a capitalist
raw-materials production for English industry, and the enslavement of
four million black Africans who were sold to America by European
slave-traders, to be used as labor-power on the cotton, sugar and
tobacco plantations under the command of capital.

In this way, one continent after another comes inextricably under the
rule of capital, and on every continent one territory after another, one
race after another, with ever new and uncounted millions succumbing to
proletarianization, enslavement, insecurity of existence, in short,
immiseration. The establishment of the capitalist world economy brings
in its wake the spread of ever greater misery, an unbearable burden of
labor and a growing insecurity of existence across the whole globe,
corresponding to the accumulation of capital in a few hands. The
capitalist world economy increasingly means the yoking of all humanity
to heavy labor with countless deprivations and sufferings, with physical
and mental degeneration for the purpose of capital accumulation. We have
seen how capitalist production has the peculiarity that consumption,
which in every previous economic form is the purpose, is here only a
means, simply a way of serving the real purpose: the accumulation of
capitalist profit. The self-expansion of capital appears as alpha and
omega, as the intrinsic purpose and meaning of all production. The
craziness of this situation, however, only appears to the extent that
capitalist production develops into world production. Here, on the scale
of the world economy, the absurdity of the capitalist economy attains
its true expression in the picture of all humanity groaning with
frightful suffering under the yoke of a blind social power, capital,
that it has itself unconsciously created. The underlying purpose of
every social form of production, the maintenance of society by labor,
the satisfaction of its needs, is placed here completely on its head,
with production not being for the sake of people, but production for the
sake of profit becoming the law all over the earth, with the
under-consumption, constant insecurity of consumption, and sometimes
direct non-consumption of the immense majority of people becoming the
rule.

At the same time, the development of the world economy also leads to
other important phenomena, important even for capitalist production
itself. As we said, there are two stages in the intrusion of the rule of
European capital into non-European countries: first the entry of trade,
with the indigenous people being drawn into commodity exchange, and to
some degree also the transformation of the existing forms of production
of the indigenous peoples into commodity production; then the
expropriation of these peoples from their land, in one form or another,
i.e. from their means of production. These means of production are
transformed into capital in the hands of the Europeans, while the
indigenous peoples are transformed into proletarians. These two steps,
however, are sooner or later followed by a third: the founding of
capitalist production in the colonial country itself, either by emigrant
Europeans or by enriched indigenous individuals. The United States of
America, which was only populated by English and other European
emigrants once the native redskins had been exterminated in a long war,
first formed an agricultural hinterland of capitalist Europe, supplying
raw materials such as cotton and grain for English industry, and
customers for industrial products of every kind from Europe. In the
second half of the nineteenth century, however, the United States
developed its own industry, which not only displaced imports from
Europe, but soon presented a tough competition to European capitalism in
Europe itself, as well as on other continents. In India, English
capitalism has similarly been faced with dangerous competition from an
indigenous textile industry and others. Australia has embarked on the
same path of development from a colonial country into a country of
capitalist industry. In Japan, an indigenous industry developed already
with the first step -- under the impulse of foreign trade -- and
preserved Japan from partition as a European colony. In China the
process of fragmentation and plundering of the country by European
capitalism has been complicated by China's effort, with the aid of
Japan, to found its own capitalist production as a defence against the
European, though this attempt also leads to increased and complicated
sufferings for its population. In this way, not only does the rule and
command of capital spread over the whole earth by the creation of a
world market, but the capitalist mode of production itself spreads
steadily across the whole earth. This however means that the need of
production to expand comes into an ever more unhappy relationship with
its terrain of expansion, its outlet opportunities. It is the innermost
need of capitalist production, as we have seen, the very law of its
existence, that it should have the possibility of not remaining stable
but extending ever more widely and ever more rapidly, i.e. producing
ever greater masses of commodities, in ever larger factories, and ever
more rapidly, with ever better technical means. This expansion
possibility of capitalist production knows no inherent limits, since
there are no limits to technological progress and hence to the
productive powers of the earth. But this need for expansion does come up
against quite particular limits, i.e. those of the interest of
capitalist profit. Production and its expansion only have a sense if
they yield at least the "customary" average profit. Whether this is the
case depends on the market, i.e. on the relationship between effective
demand on the part of consumers, and the amount of commodities produced
along with their prices. The interest of capitalist profit requires on
the one hand an ever more rapid and greater production, thereby creating
of itself at each step market limitations that stand in the way of the
impetuous expansive pressure of production. The result of this, as we
have seen, is the unavoidability of industrial and trade crises, which
periodically balance the relationship between the inherently unbounded,
limitless capitalist pressure of production and the barriers to
capitalist consumption, and make possible the continued existence of
capitalism and its further development.

Yet the more countries develop a capitalist industry of their own, the
greater is the need and possibility for expansion of production, while
the smaller in relation to this is the possibility of expansion due to
market barriers. If we compare the leaps by which English industry grew
in the 1860s and 70s, when England was still the leading capitalist
country on the world market, with its growth in the last two decades,
since Germany and the United States have significantly displaced England
on the world market, it is clear that growth has become much more slow
in relation to the previous period. But what was the particular fate of
English industry unavoidably faces German and North American industry
too, and eventually the industry of the whole world. Incessantly, with
each step of its own further development, capitalist production is
approaching the time when its expansion and development will be
increasingly slow and difficult. Of course, capitalist development still
has a good way to go, as the capitalist mode of production proper still
represents only a very small fraction of total production on earth. Even
in the oldest industrial countries of Europe, there are still alongside
large industrial firms very many small and backward artisanal workshops,
and above all, much the greater part of agricultural production is not
capitalist but still pursued along peasant lines. There are also whole
countries in Europe in which large-scale industry is hardly developed,
local production still bearing a principally peasant and artisanal
character. And finally, in the other continents, with the exception of
the northern part of America, capitalist production sites are only small
and scattered points, while whole immense expanses of land have in part
not even made the transition to simple commodity production. Of course,
the economic life of all these strata of society and countries that do
not produce capitalistically, both in Europe and elsewhere, is dominated
by capitalism. The European peasant may still conduct the most primitive
economy on his holding, but he is dependent at every turn on the
big-capitalist economy, on the world market, with which he has been
brought into contact by trade and by the tax policy of the large
capitalist states. In the same way, the most primitive countries outside
of Europe have been brought by world trade and colonial policy under the
sway of European and North American capitalism. The capitalist mode of
production is still able to achieve powerful expansion by everywhere
suppressing all more backward forms of production. In generally, the
movement, as we have seen, is in this direction. But precisely through
this development capitalism becomes caught in a fundamental
contradiction. The more that capitalist production takes the place of
more backward forms, the more tightly the limits placed on the market by
the interest of profit constrict the need of already existing capitalist
firms to expand. The matter becomes clear if we imagine for a moment
that the development of capitalism has proceeded so far that on the
whole earth everything that people produce is produced capitalistically,
i.e. only by private capitalist entrepreneurs in large firms with modern
wage-workers. Then the impossibility of capitalism clearly appears.
